0|Dear Dad|"    I stopped wearing bras in high school.  
    And no, I didn’t do it for some feminist statement.  



    I stopped wearing them for the exact reason you wouldn’t want 
    me to.  
    I liked when people looked at me.  

 

    I threw away all my Fruit of the Loom packaged underwear.  
    I went to “Romance” stores, and I’ll save you the pain  
    Of describing what I bought.  



    You can probably already guess.   



    I talked to strange men in strange places.  
    They whispered in my ear all the things they wanted to do to 
    me.  



    They whispered into the same ears that you whispered bed time 
    stories to.


    I guess I’m a different kind of princess now.



    I don’t come home much anymore. 
    You stopped calling because you knew I wouldn’t answer.



    I travel around the city a lot. I’ve met a lot people you’d 
    disapprove of.



    I make my own ways of making ends meet.
    I walk streets with other girls like me.



    It was a normal night. 
    Working in red light.



    A car pulled up beside me and 
    Rolled down the window.



    A familiar voice rang out, “How much?”




    But I guess you didn’t recognize your own daughter.

1|My girlfriend of 5 years broke up with me yesterday. I wrote this poem after doing our laundry last night.|"I did our laundry yesterday.

My face was just as wet as all the

Clothes hung up to dry




I saw the sweater that I bought you

For Last Christmas that I gave you early

to see you smile




I did our laundry yesterday.

I saw the shirt that you wore on the

Second day we met




I smelled your perfume on your favorite shirt

The one that calms me down

Better than the meds I used to take




I saw my shirt that you had ripped

When we were just two kids

Brand new lovers killing time




I saw the dress shirt I had worn

When you told me we’d bring a little

Baby in this world




I saw the jacket I was wearing

When we smiled at each other 

When she said that “it’s a girl”




I saw the clothes we used to buy

at the thrift store by your work

I couldn’t tell which sweater’s mine




I did our laundry yesterday.

I did it all real slowly cause

It might be the last time




I cannot bear to see you go

We’re all I’ve ever known

And all I’ve wanted in this life




I do my best to give you space

To take it easy on all of these long texts

I send at night




But it’s hard for me to face

I cannot put to words

How I’ve been feeling in this way




I guess I’ll just say please don’t go

I’d give it all I could give just to hear

That you would stay




But I did our laundry yesterday

I couldn’t bear the thought of dividing

Yours with what is mine




I’ll do our laundry again today

Not because it’s dirty

I just want to

One last time

2|A poem I wrote about god when I was high on ecstasy|"If my body is a temple 

Then I'm a shitty tenant 

Bonfires in the living room 

House parties every other minute 

&nbsp;


Blatant disregard 

As all the walls grow cracked and charred

Foundation down to rubble

The hardwood floor is chipped and scarred 


&nbsp;


Outside it's always pouring rain 

The ceiling sighs and sinks with leaks 

Angry letters to the architect 

That I may never meet

Nobody wants you to drag the mood down.

You’re not dying of hunger. 


You’re not homeless.

mountain out of a molehill again.


Just keep going,

we can put up with it.


You just keep saying 


you can’t.


Why?


We never saw it coming. You were always so happy and upbeat. We never noticed you stopped writing poems and songs. Maybe that was the problem. You never came to any of us for help. You always kept going and kept smiling, always looking on the bright side. You had it all.You weren’t hungry, or homeless, or sick. You seemed so grateful for the life you had. We never knew the mountain of life you faced, and we should have known that you couldn’t put up with it. You never came to us for help. Why didn’t you come for help? 


We loved you.

4|Sex is a conversation|"You once said,  
'Sex, is a conversation',  
Well then I wonder how we'd speak.  
With muted sighs and tender cries,  
Or something less oblique?  

Before the talking starts, I'd take  
Your shoes and walk your streets,  
To see if blisters,  
From our whispers,  
Whisked you off your feet.

You once said,  
'Sex, is a conversation',  
Maybe I'm the quiet type.  
I'll spin these words but speak unheard,  
In case you spring to flight. 

If looks could kill,   
Then I'm a ghost,      
Who floats from scene to scene,  
Just passing through the passers-by,  
Whose hearts you always win.

You once said,  
'Sex, is a conversation',  
If that's the case then I'm all ears,  
But strings have tripped and tamed my tongue,  
And I'm no puppeteer. 

We know that what I write of,    
Can never be displayed.  
But if we sat,  
And had a chat,  
I wonder what we'd say?

5|Rhyming Poetry|" Modern poems shouldn’t rhyme.

They never flow. There’s never time

To craft a verse that speaks in song,

It doesn’t work, and just sounds wrong.

Metered beats that count the bars,

And meeting measures, counting stars,

That stain the page in inky blots,

A sky of commas, words, full stops.

See - modern poems shouldn’t rhyme,

They feel pushed, and every line,

Will scream a scene of forced allure,

That readers seem to deem a chore.

So when you write, just keep in mind;

If modern poems shouldn’t rhyme,

That it’s your verse, and it’s your ink,

So fuck what other people think.

And the same veins through our foreheads.   
Living there, in the hollowed-out spaces between your vein and mine,   
I became versed in the art of becoming transparent.
 
&nbsp;

Slipping through wooden doorways dented and splintered by fury,  
Stepping delicately over minefields hidden under plush carpets of kindred smiles,  
My silent rhythms were tuned to those syncopated beats  
that punctuated your tired tin can symphony of expectations.

&nbsp;
 
In that place, I carved my comforts from the gaps   
between our matching picket-fence-teeth,  
and enclosed myself behind thick, sturdy walls   
built from borrowed bricks of wry laughter.

Now, when my lover asks me why I love her so quietly,  
I want to whisper to her:  
*When eggshells are your floorboards,  
you learn to lighten your bones.*

9|My father said he killed a man|"first time poster, long time watcher

My father said to me,

on my 16th birthday my father said to me: “I killed a man for calling your mom a bitch.”

That was a lie. 

My father explained to me, “I didn’t actually kill him, I had your cousin Eddy kill him, he owed me a favor”

My father had no punchline. there was no laughter. 

My father hugs me twice every time I leave home, because he’ll miss me double

My father had to get on antidepressants when I moved out at 16 because my disregard for his feelings sent him into a depressive state 
He calls them his “dont kill people pills” 

I cried, I cry 

My father said this was done because you don’t let anyone disrespect your family. 

My Father says there is a war on christmas. He says Merry Christmas in July. He says Xmas is attacking his beliefs and taking the christ out of christmas

My Father disowned me when I was 26, on christmas for being liberal

My father took the son out of family 

My father took my best friend and I to the zoo when we were 6 because Bobby wanted to see penguins before he died. 

My father took me to the funeral when Bobby died later that month from Cancer

My father gave a homeless man $1,000 and turned to me and said, treat everyone with dignity, then turned to the man and said “you’ll be fine”

My father says racism was eradicated until Obama became president. 

My father calls every black man “N-word Ned” But he uses a hard R

My father taught me that if someone hurts you, don’t let them see you cry, just make sure that you eventually make them cry

My father beat me with a belt when I called him a hypocrite 

I cry, I cried

My Father said that I represent him, that I represent my families name. 

My father slapped my mother once after she slapped him

My father said “don’t hit like a man if you don’t want to be hit like a man”

I see parts of him in me, half my best parts. 

I wake up every day scared that I also got his bad parts.

On the other hand

My mother said to me: I love you

I’m not afraid of her bad parts 

She cries when I cry

11|I Never Fell In Love With You|"
I never fell in love with you

Not even the first time I asked if you wanted to see a movie

And you looked up at me with that smile and said,

“Are you asking me on a date?”

And I barely muttered out the three letter word that changed our lives

Yes

I never fell in love with you

Not even after the first movie, or the second movie

Not even after the third movie while you were there

Laying in my arms light as a feather while butterflies bombarded my stomach

I never fell in love with you

Not even when I nervously muttered out an incoherent sentence that ended in

Girlfriend?

And you looked up at me with that perfect smile

And squealed out that three letter word that changed our lives

Yes

I swear that I never did fall in love with you

Even when we went on our picnic dates or held hands while staring up at the stars

The very stars that paled in comparison to your bright blue eyes

I never fell in love with you

Even when you kissed me like our faces had their own gravitational pull

Or like I was going off to war and we both knew I wasn’t coming back

Or like our lips were our only source of oxygen

And baby we just needed to breath

I never fell in love with you

I never fell in love with

The way you looked when we watched the sunrise from your roof

Or the way you smiled as if there was never anything to frown about

Or the smile that you put on my face

Because you made me forget there was anything to frown about

I never fell in love with you

So when you showed up to my house on that rainy afternoon

And your eyes become dark and your smile was gone

And I asked if you were breaking up with me

And you whispered that three letter word that changed our lives

Yes

I had never fallen in love with you

Not once

I never fell in love with you

Because baby, we were flying

But now I’m falling

As I watch you

Fly for another man

12|my dog is dead, does anyone know where to get lsd?|"Alone, under the burning embers of the dark heavens,  
I ask the clouds whether it is appropriate to pray.  
The palm trees drift.  
The golden-backed insects converse   
I beg for a response.  

&nbsp;  

A beetle floats in a glass of rosé.   
What is the value of life without death?   
He ponders.   
What is the race without the finish line,  
the wave without the shore to crash upon?   

&nbsp;  

A rotting chrysanthemum petal lies in a passed friend’s throat.    
Does death feel better than even the greatest pleasures of life?   
Two hotel guests stop in front of a flower.  
One wears red heels and talks about her distaste of instrumental only music.   
The other smokes a long cigar and wears a wrinkled suit.  
They pull on a petal, and it crumbles like bone-dust in a coffin.   

&nbsp;  

There is beauty within the sky.   
The stars choose not to show themselves tonight.  
The mollusks bask like sea-lions on the shore.   
They pull a high tide blanket over them   
and slip into the ocean.  

&nbsp;  

I turn to the beetle and ask him what immortality would look like.   
He tells me to look at the works of the greats:  Hemingway and Li Bai.   
Forever is only achievable through memories and influence.   
I tell him that words and ideas do not adapt to the ebb and flow of time.  

&nbsp;  
  
The peeling bark of an oak tree chimes in.   
If the dead are watching,   
do they see our mistakes?   

&nbsp;  

I tell the oak that when I look at a good friend of mine, his eyes are sad.   
They are no longer green;  
they lost their light coloring after he hit puberty.   
I am often overcome with the realization that his mother   
will not be able to attend his wedding.   

&nbsp;  

There was nothing else to be said,   
so I packed up my things.     
The beetle asked me to meet him in the next stage one day.   
I nodded and smiled.   
The human mind is a problem solving machine,   
so it frustrates me to know that he will have answers much sooner than I.

As  “AAHH!”

15|TW: Little Girls|"Trigger Warning for some pretty explicit content. I wrote this when I was still really grappling with some things about 2 years ago, and I'm finally almost feeling ready to share it with other humans. Meant to be read aloud: 

We ran across rooftops one night and kissed

on the edge; 

we stood above the world, watching the people below as their lives

passed before us – 

how easily they could see us, skin exposed, lips touching,   
 but no one ever looks up; 

and somewhere between touching the sky and falling

into your bed, you said, 

“You’re fun,” And I don’t know what that means – In fact, 

I have it on good authority that I’m not. 

&nbsp;

At age six, A.J. calls me “goody\-two\-shoes” 

because I’m afraid of getting caught out of class. 

At eight, I learn what it means to be a “stand\-in friend” 

when my sister isn’t around to play, 

and at thirteen, Brittany’s trying to hand me pills that she found 

on the street and telling me that I’m not fun

like my sister. 

She would have taken them. 

She’s not afraid. 

&nbsp;

I’m thirteen, and I learn to stay inside because around here 

men drive around with their pants down 

and girls disappear in the middle of the day – 

found later weighing five pounds less from loss of dignity. 

&nbsp;

I’m thirteen, and I’m always home, because I think

that I can somehow tether my sister and my mother

to our apartment, to me, 

if I can cook and clean and keep everyone safe. 

&nbsp;

I’m thirteen, and older guys come and go from our home, 

like it’s theirs, 

like my sister is theirs, 

and it’s like their belts are always undone, their faces 

always hungry, 

and when I try to make them leave they burn me

with their cigarettes; bang on the doors and rattle 

the windows. And they’re laughing and yelling

and I’m standing in the middle of the room with 

my hands pressed against my ears counting the different ways

to die.

&nbsp;

I’m thirteen, and my sister is missing.

My mother sits at home watching television, and I’m searching 

the neighborhood with a girl and her grandmother. 

&nbsp;

She’s fourteen, and we find her outside the house

of the boy whose brand is still fresh on my thigh, 

and she’s surrounded by men – 

Big men

Tall men

Older men

Drinking and laughing men

&nbsp;

My sister falls on me, and I realize that I can’t hear anything. 

Their faces all blurred into one giant portrait of 

the bad things that happen to little girls when they get caught, 

and someone needs to remind me to walk. 

&nbsp;

She’s fourteen and describing the things that he made her do to his dick. 

She’s fourteen and her eyes are rolling back into her head. 

She’s fourteen and the EMTs have to put her on a stretcher because she can’t stand.

&nbsp;

and somewhere in the background my mother is stopping

her boyfriend from going over there to kill someone; 

and maybe she’s right; 

and maybe I’m the one who’s crazy, 

but what kind of mother says, 

&nbsp;

“No. Don’t hurt the man who raped my baby.” 

&nbsp;

My kind of mother protects rapists.

My kind of mother always puts the man first. 

And my kind of mother has plenty of experience

because for years she shielded my father from view

hovering above us like a dark cloud while he raped me

again and again.

&nbsp;

My kind of mother sends children out alone

into a world where it’s too dangerous 

to borrow sugar from your neighbor, and when

we come back bruised and broken, 

she tells us to sit down and shut up or

she’ll give us something to cry about. 

&nbsp;

For my kind of mother, this is just another thing

she has to deal with. 

&nbsp;

And when at sixteen, I told her that Eric had molested me, 

my kind of mother invited him to stay in our home and told him

he was like a son to her. 

&nbsp;

So I learned to say, “yes,” when I’m scared and violence is the only other answer,

to say, “yes,” when they need me, when they want me, when I have to,

to say, “yes,” least of all, when I want to. 

&nbsp;

When you say I’m fun, I don’t know what you mean, 

but I hope it means you like me, that I pleased you. 

I hope it means I’m safe, 

but if you don’t call me tomorrow or next week – 

If you don’t call me again, that’s okay, 

because somewhere inside me, I’m still just afraid of

the bad things that happen to little girls when they get caught.

Daylight buries darkness  
until  
darkness buries daylight.   
Night ending the mourning.  
Wolves howling   
for moonlight harvest.

19|How To Write A Poem|"Start with a feeling.

It's not so much a feeling that you have on your own --

It's a manufactured thing, something you claw out of the earth

With soft, unfocused hands,

As if God will spit gold onto your fingers at random.

Call it ""finding inspiration"" when you bare your teeth at the sky

And demand beauty from it.

Finally find it when the clouds cry on your window with their

*Pitter-pat-pat,*

Tapping on the glass, whimpering:

""Is this what you wanted?""

But it's not -- not quite, not exactly,

Not that imagined ecstasy in the mind.

Look at the rain, shrug;

It'll do.

&#x200B;

Now, take words and lay them out on an operating table.

They are stripped and silent -- worthless

Until you make something of them.

Pick the ones you like and toss the rest;

Tear them apart, letter by letter --

By sound, by the taste of them on your tongue,

This one too bitter, that one too sweet --

And paste them down on posterboard

Like a ransom note to the world.

Lay with them; let their blood dry to a paste.

The copper of it starts to sting.

Rip it up.

Try again.

&#x200B;

Now, bring it outside--

This Frankenstein's monster of beauty and torture--

Thrust it on stage and make it dance.

Watch its feet move in that strange ballet

That isn't quite lovely but not quite bleak;

Make it sing, and it comes out strangled.

And this thing that was beaten out of the world,

Out of your soul, is just as sad and broken

As you are.

And when you cast it out and beg to God:

""Make it beautiful -- make *me* beautiful""--

When you take that broken glass and turn it

Not on the world but on yourself,

That is poetry.

&#x200B;

Rip it up.

Try again.

&#x200B;

20|On Depression|"The universe says “expand”,  
 
But I cannot fathom building a legacy so disproportionate to the cosmos,  

That would take another mere hundred years to dissipate.

&nbsp;

I want to occupy no space at all,  
 
Tuck each tenuous limb inwards,  

And slip into a vacuum  

Before the reverberation of my heartbeat tunnels into consciousness –  
 
“You  
 
are still  
 
here”.  

&nbsp;

Each thought, deafening,  
 
Taunts me,  
 
Sprouting outstretched appendages and eyes of obsidian craters,  
 
Pantomiming sluggishly in reverse,  

Like unhinged clowns underwater.  

&nbsp;

“Collapse, collapse, collapse”,  

They command,  

With urgency that puts the universe to shame.

21|Other people give their hearts to a lover.|"Other people give their hearts to a lover. I gave you the freckle on my collarbone.

You claimed it as yours one day while we lay tangled in each other

and the sunbeams

and in the ghosts of other women.

Staving off the day and exploring all the centimeters of flesh that anchored us to the mattress,

you danced your fingertips over the parts of me that I ached to keep concealed.

You called it your *Aluniţă—*

Feminine noun, again. Like all the words that hold us to our womanhood by the tips of sharpened tongues—

So I carved her out with a butter knife,

and served her to you on that platter with mangoes and beer bread and two-bit poetry.

All I asked in return was that spot just above the curve of your left ankle

and some chewing gum

to mend the chink in my armor in the empty space where my freckle used to be.

Sometimes, nowadays, when I look in the mirror I lament the bareness of my collarbone,

and I become nostalgic for the time before you loved her,

when my skin was my own to call by name.

But then I turn to barter away that gap that sits between my two front teeth

to the woman with the voice that has all the richness of moss-covered bark in a rainstorm

And I think in wonder at the lovers with only hearts to give.

i'll find a church

and fold my skin

i'll wear the black

i'll snort a line

and for two hours forget that my 20s

25|Fentanyl|"&#x200B;

My brother and I carefully place pennies on the rails behind my great-grandmother's house.

We wait for a coal train to squish them.

It's fun until I realize we can’t buy anything with flat disks of zinc.

Are you able to hit the breaks?

Or,  do you need me to put my heart out like a new penny?

How many people have pulled themselves to pieces by the tracks?

Were they hoping, like me, that their flattened bodies might become something useful?

I’m holding your head as feel you die.

It’s so fast the empty space where your soul had been blows through my hair.

Or maybe it’s been a season.

A syringe turns into a dead leaf and slowly falls out of your fingers.

Your lips become a frozen lake.

I’m shivering, naked, screaming your name into a blizzard.

A paramedic tells me you’re lucky, but I can’t hear her over the wind from a train we can’t stop.

27|When I Touched Her|" 

When I touched her 

She melted.

And I poured her clarity 

Into a long necked vase, 

Put it on the windowsill, and 

Waited for the light to come through.

Because when it hit just right

She became infinite colour

And our molecules would dance

Through the living room and into the kitchen.

I would soak up the energy 

And wring myself out at the sink.

I would watch every drop circle down the drain 

And then wait, 

For the light to come back.

    with a coffee
    and a cigarette
    and hoped dark waves would swallow up
    this apathy. 
    
    Honestly, Captain Ahab had nothing to complain about because 
    he lost a leg but at least he could wake up and tell himself
    ""yes, I am looking for something and it is colossal and great""
    
    and I bet he never pondered over novels from 167 years ago
    or if the way he answered the lady at the grocery store was too mean
    or the long silence between this moment
    and the next.

34|To The Children Whose Parents Pay My Mother|"This one is for the children

whose parents pay my mother

to listen to their kids talk

for an hour or so each week;

You get more of my mother
in one session

than I have received in twenty years.

Did you know that

having my mother listen to your feelings

for an hour each week

is a gift that I never recieved?



Did you know that

when I was having issues

my mother didn't ask me how I felt

or ask me to talk to her about

what I was going through, no.

Her reaction was to send me

to some stranger (a student from her school)

to practice on me for a discounted price.

And, now, she is getting paid to care about you
.
Which leads me to wonder that,

maybe, if I had paid for her time

maybe my mother would have listened to me too.



To the children who get more attention from my mother

than I ever dared ask for

where were you during the divorce that almost happened?

Because I was there

feeling every heartache with you, Mom!

Crying at a forever tainted Dairy Queen

that you brought me to, trying to soften the harsh blow

of the ugly word “divorce”, with a guilty offering of ice cream.

I brought that Blizzard home with me,

uneaten, and (after weeks) threw it in the trash

yet the cold lingered in my heart and in our house
for years.



To the children who see my mother every week;

Where were you when my mother was sad?

Because I was always there, and Mom?

You were always sad.

And I always listened to you

So why couldn’t you just listen to me Mom? 

You once told me you door was always open

but it was only open on your terms.

Only if I acted like the perfect daughter 

that I never managed to be.

Your door was shut to the real me.



To the children whose parents pay my mother

to listen to their kids feelings for an hour or so every week;

I wonder, do your parents listen to you?

35|On Depression - My first attempt at a rhyming poem|"Or more accurately, on intrusive thoughts and pushing on

&#x200B;

**Mine**

A great sick’ning beast

took root in my chest;

It sneers at my dreams,

And steals all my rest.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

It swims in my stomach,

Burns all my hair,

And when I hide from it,

It follows me there.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

It turned my heart to a stone,

And my pupils to prisons.

It’s taken my freedom,

My choice, and decisions.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

But the beast is my own,

Grown from my suppression;

The pain is an answer,

To a self-loathing question.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

So I will dig on,

While my thoughts misbehave;

My heart on my sleeve,

And my foot in the grave.

&#x200B;

36|I got drunk and wrote this poem. I'm a scientist and never write shit, also I suck.|"Sometimes I think

Ill be buried as the Byzantines

My heart skips a beat

A young boy

Sits in a galactic carriage

He turns to page 683 

And thinks of me"
37|make your heart the prettiest thing about you|"Suffocate individuality

Under a pillow with leftover mascara 

From the night before, 

I never wore adidas as a fashion statement, 

Couldn’t ever afford the cost

Of a dentist appointment. 

Never got a flower

I wouldn’t tear apart

For the lady packing groceries 

At the closest quickie mart. 

Look me in the eyes 

And tell me you don’t see beauty 

In the way I giggle compliments 

Out crookedly 

Like a pair of mismatched socks that go perfectly 
together.

Not a day goes by that I don’t think about imperfection. 

The ideal body instead an empty box 

Wrapped with silk ribbon and red velvet paper, 

Wondering why this maker in the sky

Decided to put a tooth on the top shelf 

Of my smile. 

Why I look at beauty standards like limbo

But the bar is skimming the floor, and everyone is just going lower and lower,

And I was the only one who wanted to step over it. 

Why when I meet someone, my toes curl 

And my heart hurls

A million reasons why someone could love them. 

I am not a neck breaker, 

Just a hand shaker. 

I won’t knock the wind out of you 

But I’ll give you my jacket. 

I’ll give you my last fruit and leave myself 

With an empty basket. 

I don’t turn heads, I twist minds. 

Heart strings in my hands 

Drip like watermelon rinds

Because I make you feel inside. 

It’s low tide, but the waves are rising. 

Your scared of genuine but it’s sweet like icing, 

I’m enticing but on the inside where it counts. 

I’m the type of person you can’t live without

Because of the words that are formed by my mouth. 

A plethora of color and

A touch of grey, 

A sunset after the longest day, 

Open mind molded with clay 

But crafted with fingertips so delicate 

You wouldn’t think that lily pads could float. 

Raise a toast to the strangers on the street,

Say kind things to every person you meet 

Because they are me. 

They are us. 

Unconventional at best, 

Giving whatever I can to the rest 

But I can only send you home with this; 

The beauty from your heart 

Is an eternity of bliss.

38|Parent's Circle|"Three years before you died,  
your school threw a Christmas party.  
The other mothers chattered by the drinks table;  
timid children wheeled out, stylishly accessorized  
with carefully rehearsed handshakes.  
But we sat in the corner, you and I;  
and you read me a softcover book  
about a boy who went to the moon.

&nbsp;

Nine days after you died,  
the neighbour's girl found their cat  
(Mister Marley, twenty-two)  
dead in their front garden.  
I came outside when I heard her crying,  
but her mother, ashen faced,  
pulled her inside, with stuttered apologies.  
Leaving me alone with awkward echoes  
and an old, dead cat.

&nbsp;

Four weeks before you died,  
you spent the day with me at work.    
I packed your toys, your books,  
but you just sat by Suzie's desk  
and watched her make calls.  
When I asked why,  
you said she talked like me. 

&nbsp;

The month after you died,  
the counsellor (Annie, she insisted, never Doctor Liu)  
gave me a pamphlet.  

""Parent's circle,"" it read.  
""For those who've had a loss"".  


Three weeks, it hung on the fridge,  
until I caved and went,  
but despite the hour drive  
I left five minutes in.  

An empty room with nine adults;  
each treading water  
in a private ocean  
of incalculable grief.

&nbsp;

The day before you died,  
we sat by the river  
and I sang to you,  
an advertising song from television  
while you threw stale bread to the ducks.

&nbsp;

Four years after you died,  
Helen, an intern in accounting,  
told us her sister just had a boy.  
""Harry,"" she said, ""and he's the cutest thing you've ever seen"".  
My assistant (who you watched, that summer day)  
remembered that was your name;  
and she apologised in the elevator afterward,  
as if you are ever far from my mind.  

&nbsp;

The day you died,  
I chipped a nail.  
I was late to move my car at lunch,  
and an inspector wrote me a ticket.  
I stood on the curb, trucks rumbling past  
as in my pocket, my phone began to ring.

41|Have you seen him naked?|"    have you ever seen a boy naked?    
    really naked  
    his ribcage bare and rising like bread beside you  
    the hair on his thighs bristling;  
    dry, skeleton stalks in gooseflesh Autumn fields  
    ribcage falling as he exhales, as his heart pumps blood into breath into life

    has a naked boy ever slept beside you?  
    two shoulder blades splayed wide as an open journal  
    the trench between them littered with freckles, dandelion blackheads, 
    pimples and a birthmark cast like a strange parasite  
    a scar and battlefields of stretch marks on his bum  
    which even then, is lovely in its own way

    has a boy ever been naked before you?  
    really naked  
    has he turned to face you after the golden hours fade, and said:  
    “I’m afraid of the world and what it wants from me”  
    “The things in my head don’t make sense”  
    has he ever laid his forehead into the puzzle piece groove of your chest   
    has he let it out, quietly or like the clouds

    have you ever seen him naked?  
    this boy without clothes or a wall about him  
    trembling not from lack of warmth, nor out of shame  
    baring his being: his solitary belly button, the yawning thing between his legs,  
    the shifting truths and kaleidoscope fears inside his soul  
    do you coax them out with a warm, empathic coo  
    and as you have seen him, has he seen you?

The kind of fine that feels like an over-worn knitted sweater

meeting a stubborn splintered desk corner, unraveling wildly

against the tug of not doing enough, not saying enough, not trying enough, not listening enough, not being enough--

or the kind of fine that feels like two searing knives dipped in poison

playing tic-tac-toe on your chest

except no one ever wins or loses or cares or tries or listens 

and everything hurts and nothing hurts and it's all fine--really fine.

The kind of fine that wakes you up at 3:09AM

smelling like thick smoke and burning wood

as it billows underneath your bedroom door

but you're on the second level of your stepdad's house and

you're too scared to jump so all there's left to do is panic

or cry or suffocate or open the window and yell for help

but no one is coming

so you attempt to calm yourself

by thinking of other things

like

When you crawled into my head


And dragged out all my demons


To dance around my bed.

When I lay there bent


And broken as all my reasons


Came crashing down, crying as you said:


&nbsp;


“I thought that’s what love meant”


You mean to be used, abused and sent


Back to the east, to change the seasons


And find the sun among the dead?


&nbsp;


“I thought that’s what love meant”


I’ll say to my friends and lament


How easily you eased in


And that I didn’t give consent.


&nbsp;


Because I thought that’s what love meant:


Crying after sex, as you washed yourself to repent


For violating and manipulating, and giving me lesions


To stitch in my head and reinvent-


&nbsp;


I thought that’s what love meant.


But now I’m sleeping with strangers to descend


Into the night and the rain, screaming


At the moon, hoping to ascend.

Adieu, you cunt.

50|She Killed Herself Blah Blah Blah|"&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I killed a mouse. I did not realize it was a mother. A few minutes later I found four baby mice tucked away in an old rag I used to dry off my car last summer.

&#x200B;

Don't worry, 

they couldn't watch her die.

Mother never got to pry open their

eyes, so this bunch of baby mice

with baby bliss

never had to worry 

about eyes. 

&#x200B;

My mind has a black fog, 

I don't know what it's called

but I pray that it's not called ""me"" 

It has a death grip on my brain that needs pried loose. 

&#x200B;

I don't want to live 

in my congested brain. 

I want to live but 

only in the hot lava on my chest

from long ago, 

many months ago, 

when I'd walk under loud maple trees, 

feeling the orange and feeling the breeze, 

just thinking of ways to be 

the best man I can be 

for her, and perhaps even myself. 

&#x200B;

I want to live but 

only if I find a new nightmare 

that doesn't just zoom 

closer and closer into 

that impenetrable wall 

of soaking brunette hair 

that I playfully flipped, 

grapevining her damn beautiful face

that she hated. 

&#x200B;

If I had found these four hopeless mice last August 

I'd have gently pressed a warm and wet 

Q-tip against their bloated bits to mimic 

the tongue of their mother. 

Baby mice need to shit and piss, 

that's how mother mouse gets her babies

to shit and piss and live. 

&#x200B;

But it's not August, there's 

no lava on my chest. 

It's time to ditch 

eraser-sized rodents 

in the woods, 

but I'm too busy. 

&#x200B;

My lava left me and let me down 

but so did the rope. 

It did the ropedy-dope and broke, 

branding a brush-burn into my neck 

that spoke to me like Anne Sullivan, 

but in the language of burning skin

instead of water and vibrations. 

The muscles in my neck turned 

acoustic and my burning skin 

told me that if I try 

to kill myself again 

to just forget about it, 

I don't deserve to live. 

Not for myself, not even for 

her damn beautiful face 

that she wasted. 

&#x200B;

The black fog had a death grip. 

I pried it loose, put it in a balloon 

with baby mice, filled the balloon with helium then let go.

52|My Grandfather's Clock|"My grandfather’s clock died in much the same way as he did.

As the years passed its gears began to slow, and its voice grew softer.

I believe it began to count as it ticked away its own remaining seconds.

&#x200B;

It began to forget—forget how to tell time; forget how to speak; forget that we were there,

watching, listening, always hoping for one more toll of its weary voice.

When it expired its hands were clasped together—somewhere between the seven and eight.

&#x200B;

There was little in the way of visual cues to signify its passing.

It looked the same in death as it had in life; its wooden body was strong and weathered.

But the air no longer hummed as it used to.

&#x200B;

My grandfather’s clock died before I could tell time.

It died before I could appreciate its monotonous tick, its hourly drone.

I hear it was really something special; they don’t make clocks like that anymore.

there would be no scene, 

no hubbub, 

no crush of lights and sounds,

Relapse,

The big “R” word,

Will hang over your heads

Like carrion crows

&#x200B;

As they circle

And dive,

You can bat them

Away

With frail hands.

&#x200B;

To the addict

You might even

Seem

To fit the mold,

&#x200B;

But you’re not God.

&#x200B;

So how do you

Save

An addict?

&#x200B;

The hard answer is

You don’t.

&#x200B;

You let them 

Go.

&#x200B;

To find what

Fills the hole

Completely.

57|i haven’t done drugs in a while but i’d definitely snort excedrin with you|"I was kissing you and your lips tasted like velvet,   
our tongues red carpets into each other,    
our saliva   
divas strutting gorgeously,   
famously, furiously,  
I wish I could carve your name into the sky with an emerald pen.   


&nbsp;


I close my eyes and picture your smile,    
teeth like gemstones or glass artifacts,    
are you my windows-tinted curious-pyramid Louvre?     


&nbsp;


I can’t stop exploring you,   
walking around the rooms tucked behind your ears,    
the dimmed theaters beneath your breasts,   
kissing around your belly button,  
drain your body,   
dig into you, light nips on your throat like a fully-maned untamed lion.  


&nbsp;


You’re miles away but you’re right next to me,  
training wheels off and maybe I didn’t know love   
until you hung yourself on me,    
soaking wet towel, sopped up sweat,   
displayed on a volleyball net.  


&nbsp;


Are we teachers to the people we love?    
or are we just    
angels,    
biblical, euphoric,    
tastebuds drenched in the warm light of halos,    
legs wrapped around my back,    
I call you monkey, bear cubs playing,   
tearing my shirt off in the car.    


&nbsp;


Now you’re peppermint poundcake,     
fluffy and soft like freshly picked daisies in the spring,    
I want to whisper that I love you,   
but you’re asleep,   
I won’t hang up the phone because time is precious,   
so I’ll write you a poem instead   
just to figure out  
the right way to explain that when I look at you  
I see a blanket by a hearthstone.

This is a poem about those dinosaurs

and how people wrecked things

61|Weeds From Yesterday|"**Weeds From Yesterday**

&#x200B;

I didn't decide to smile today.

&#x200B;

I woke up and my bones creaked like

Frogs in a pond,

And my mind was still full

Of weeds from yesterday

And you had already left.

&#x200B;

I heard laughter outside

So I got up and parted the window shutters

With my fingers

And let some yellow in--

&#x200B;

You were sitting in the garden

With your eyes closed

Our daughter was laughing and

Putting lilies in your hair,

Her hands were covered with mud

And you pretended

Not to notice

And something bad inside me

Went away.

&#x200B;

I didn't decide to smile today.

&#x200B;

I just let it

Hang that way.

instead of the needle or the pipe or the razor or the computer screen  
it’s scrubbing the floor or trimming a tree or visiting family or writing a poem.

Oh that’s good  
Oh fuck that’s good.

Ha. Everything is great. Everything’s just wonderful.

I can see the strings of reality stretched across every inch of the room  
The air itself is filled with endorphins  
Every touch is the first time a crush laid their hand on mine  
I’m never letting anyone tell me what to do again

especially myself.

They insist you lose control of yourself to the pipe, to the needle, but I know better, I know that choices are just different. Different like this feeling. This wonderful wrap of fresh, soft gauze to cover the wound, mom kissing my skinned knee.

The skinned knee  
The bee sting  
The cactus in the arm  
The quiet  
The silence  
The boredom  
The headache  
The pain I don't remember being there  
The itching the paranoia the racing thoughts the insomnia

The shaking. Why the fuck am I still shaking.   
I gave you what you wanted   
why can’t you let me feel normal 

Razor-white-lines-pipe-bud-nug-glass-bottle-smoke-lighter.   
C’mon.   
C’mon.

Oh.  
Thank you.

Headache shaking needles razors belts sponges spoons clear, transcendental liquid to mix with red as it courses through my heart to launch me to spiritual enlightenment   
Just tonight   
Just tonight

No. This won’t work.  
That’s it: I’m quitting tomorrow.

Just after this once.

A call from mom. I’ll answer

65|catholic school|"Satan sits on my left shoulder and controls my right hand.   
He tells me secrets about myself and makes me swear I   won’t tell a soul;  
he asks me if I’m more afraid to wake up or if I’m more   afraid to go to sleep.  
&nbsp;  
  
He believes in me.   
If I could feel him I know he’d be like a Bali road   
or the driveway outside my mother’s house.  
I lie shirtless on the asphalt and ask him  
how much pressure is required to break a ribcage.  
   
&nbsp;  
  
He tells me that he doesn’t know,  
but reminds me that I’ve written that image before in a poem just like this one;  
I should stop in my tracks.    
No one likes repetition,   
and no one likes how my mind goes around and around.   
  
&nbsp;  
  
The pebbles carve semicircles on my shoulder blades.   
The flowers on the trees smile at me.  
Their white and their yellow mesh like bodies;  
Their petals like toes on new lovers.  
They smell like pink-colored perfume.  
&nbsp;  
I’ve had a repeating dream recently.   
I stand in the streets of a large city,   
lights blaring, people striding, horns honking,   
and despite the world around me, I feel desperately alone.   
&nbsp;  
I walk near a parking garage and notice a young woman.   
She looks at me sadly and I look at her sadly.  
We pretend like we don’t know each other.   
My mother calls, but I am unable to pick up.   
I can hear someone calling my name,   
but I am unable to answer.   
My heart races, but I am unable to soothe it.   
I wake in a cold sweat, but I am still lying shirtless on the asphalt.   
&nbsp;  
Exhaustion forces one to ask:  
“How much of what I see is real?”   
“How much of what I feel is real?”  
If I look too closely, my world threatens to pop,  
so my glance lingers for just a moment before I pull myself away.

68|How To Write a Love Poem in Five Easy Steps|"First, you must let yourself be swallowed by her

You must listen to the way she digests you

You must watch the cold gear of a tired jaw grind you to stardust

You must taste the things she tastes

And smell the things she smells

You must feel yourself become her if you wish to love her



Second, you must navigate her

You must become the cartographer of her hips

You must name every hair

You must know every scar and blemish like a captain knows his shore

Understand all the ways you fit into her arms

You must memorize her from rocky coast to rocky coast if you wish to love her



Third, you must bleed for her

You must let every one of her bruises bruise you instead

You must drown in your own tears just to keep her cheeks dry

You must kneel to her on broken glass

Become her knight

You must be willing to give your soul to know she’ll never have to give hers if you wish to love her



Fourth, you must kiss her

You must feel the salt of her skin between your cheeks with every breath

You must bind her like a captive in your lips

You must make time to just

Kiss her

Kiss her like she’s the last person you’ll ever see

You must make her your favorite flavor if you wish to love her



Fifth, you must hear her

You must make your cheeks curl like hers when she recounts her wild tales

You must welcome her into your ears like your favorite song

You must hum the contours of her voice as you float between her spaces

Feel the bass drum of her heartbeat

You must dance to her breath if you wish to love her



To write a love poem for her

You must write with the words she taught you

You must speak in tongues

You must spell it out in the colors of her eyes

In the long hugs that mean only themselves

You must be fluent in her if you wish to love her



If you wish to write a love poem

You must first fall in love with her

And by then

You’ll have already done it

70|sex between the planets and the stars and whatever else is out there in space|"When a star collapses within itself,     
the destruction is undeniable and cruel.     
    
&nbsp;
  
The planet-encrusted shrapnel slams     
in between the lungs of the bystanders with their     
emerald breastplates and the ashes of their parents     
tucked in between their toes so that if they perish.   
they won’t die alone.     
    
&nbsp;
  
As the universe let out a heaving sigh of surrender,     
I looked at you up on your Jupiter throne and wondered if     
you helped create this universe for the sake of destroying it.     
Your crown was made of a rose-gold only obtained down in marthart.    
It was studded with diamonds that looked like daisies     
that you plucked from the bushes outside your castle.     
    
&nbsp;
  
I presented you a sword and as i tore it from its sheath     
I nicked an artery just below your hip and I didn’t notice as the blood    
flooded the kitchen like you were Noah and the world was your arc.    
I could see the domino-effect of explosions encircling your pupils,    
the yellow sundresses were replaced with black trench coats;  
you didn’t want anyone to see the red.  
    
&nbsp;
  
I traveled in my orange space ship to retrieve what ever    
I had decided would fulfill you that day,     
losing sleep to a harsh reality of 6 am wake ups and 2 am studying sessions.     
     
&nbsp; 
    
I approached the throne when it became clear the apocalypse    
had a strong chance of obliterating the universe we so carefully   
crafted while we chipped our nails and you scratched your neck.     
I always thought we were satisfied with the end result,    
but i’ve discovered humans aren’t simple.     
   
&nbsp;
  
I asked you with my voice like Neptune,    
    
&nbsp;
  
When you held him, did you feel me?     
In the royal bed, lying on the pillow I cradled you on when your kingdom     
faced revolt, did you love him like you loved me? Did you explore him     
like how you explored me? Did you know every mark on his body?    
did you know him like you knew me?    
Did he make you feel safe?    
Did he make you feel fulfilled?        
  
&nbsp;
  
 Your tears slid down my wrist like morning dew       
and as I raised my voice I wondered where we’d gone.       
  
&nbsp;
  
 As you shuddered behind your maroon gown,    
I wondered where the hope had gone,   
where the laughter had gone.   
    
&nbsp;
  
As the stars popped like balloons around us,   
I wondered where I’d go next.   
  
&nbsp;
  
As our creation destroyed itself from the inside out,   
I looked at you and I saw a stranger,   
a parasite controlling the person I so desperately fought for,   
and as I wielded my sword for one final fight,   
I couldn’t help but wonder,  
    
&nbsp;
    
Was it worth it?

I remember thinking how fortunate you were

to understand so little of dying

&#x200B;

How death was not a destination 

But crept in under cracked fingernails

Hid in the hollow spaces between our teeth

How piecemeal the leaves expired

and abandoned their posts

How time withers - 

drop by drop

73|Suicide Poem|"A little foreword to this poem, it was written a few years ago at a time I was feeling very vulnerable. The title of the poem is the train station I had planned to kill myself at. It was written in Spanish, but I will post a translation.

&#x200B;

**Seijogakuenmae**

In this sea of human flesh

I imagine as if I were

A desolate man adrift:

Waiting in vain for tomorrow

To be saved, for tomorrow to die. ​

&#x200B;

Hope you false Goddess! ​

&#x200B;

Did you hear? It comes.

Will this be the one that takes me? ​

&#x200B;

How many bodies share with me

This train - this damned path?

How many live alone?

How many share my destination? ​

&#x200B;

Did you hear? It comes.

Will this be the one that takes me? ​

&#x200B;

This moment belongs to me:

As if the rotting space

Beneath a dead leaf

Could ever belong to it. ​

&#x200B;

Did you hear? It comes.

***ORIGINAL:***

En este mar de carne humana

Me imagino como si fuera

Un pobre a la deriva.

Esperando en vano que mañana

Se salve, que mañana se muera.

&#x200B;

Esperanza, mi diosa ilusiva!

&#x200B;

Escuchaste? Ya viene.

Sera que este me lleve?

&#x200B;

Cuantos cuerpos comparten conmigo

El tren - este maldito camino?

Cuantos que viven sin amigo?

Cuantos que comparten mi destino?

74|premonitions of your past|"you kept a dying houseplant in your room, always - 

that is to say, you kept a houseplant

that you so fervently wanted to breathe life into,

and the houseplant always had different ideas.

&#x200B;

you tried orchids, first;

blue and purple petals, unsheathed like winter coats,

shriveled, sprinkled around the base as they withered - 

potted massacres. You cried

when the last leaped off the windowsill in a gust,

a desperate attempt at salvation, perhaps. 

&#x200B;

*They're finicky*. You would murmur, hair spilling about your face

as you cooed and begged and implored

them to live. 

You stopped naming them after the third. 

&#x200B;

so then, you took up cast-irons,

sunk your fingers into their tangled roots,

stroking the dust from their fronds as you

whispered, please. 

&#x200B;

the cold took those too,

frost that struck them brittle and pale,

death creeping in slowly as you could only

watch. I found you one night on your knees. 

&#x200B;

and then, finally, inevitably, 

succulents: near indestructible, 

hearty. Requiring little to no care,

little to none of your excessant adoration. 

&#x200B;

And yet.

&#x200B;

you sobbed into my shoulder and I

wanted to shake you, wanted to ask why the fuck

you cried over these small brown carcasses

when the world served you enough sadness

to plant a garden of resentment, an orchard of spite - 

&#x200B;

The day I met your mother

I tripped over empty flowerpots

littering the front steps,

and the air was stale and stunk of neglect,

and you squeezed my hand 

like it was the only tether you could recognize,

and you shut your eyes when she closed the door - 

&#x200B;

that night, you mourned silently;

weeping over lost childhoods and dead houseplants.

75|ghosts|"in the summer we were ghosts

&nbsp;

lonely lovers who only existed

sometime in the space between 

midnight and sunrise

&nbsp;

sitting cross-legged in tennis courts

or holding hands on park swings

&nbsp;

drifting in and out of 24-hour convenience stores

sipping on slushies that made our kisses cold and blue

&nbsp;

in september 

we fell back into these earthly bodies

felt the flesh of people deemed more real

&nbsp;

we stopped haunting an empty town 

and joined the crowd instead

sometimes I wonder if we really happened at all.

76|If William Blake met Steven Hawking, and they had a baby, and that baby was a bunch of words or something.|"Where rockets land on grains of dirt

And oceans fill a spoon

Whole libraries in a single word

In a deafening empty room

When forever and ever leaves no time left

And lifetimes span a dream

And even eons forbid one breath

Much less the time to scream.

A space where space creates yet more

Since space itself expands.

A cosmos, folded, wrapped and wrought 

By eleven-dimensional hands. 

Where science, dragged off by white coats,

Let plain sense go insane

And logic lost, and chaos choked-

Yet science rules the game.

“Its about time” she said,

But thats not how she meant it.

Its about the timing; 

When the galaxies outside our solar system align

To form a perfect map of where we’ve been,

Or more perfectly where we could be.

But I can only see so far,

And you can only drift so close,

So you orbit me like the stars;

Always out of reach.

knowing I've learned my lesson painfully?

Painstakingly evaluating our every conversation,

wondering where there should have been care and intervention.

I guess they're adjusting to what's normal too.

I was out by the ocean looking for you

The low tide looks different

Alone

In the daylight

With sober eyes

&#x200B;

It's no wonder I missed my jump

Showing off for you 

At one in the morning

&#x200B;

I broke my ankle.

But I couldn't feel a thing

because you kissed my forehead

and helped me to my feet

in soaking wet tennis shoes

&#x200B;

Nobody knew we were there

And they'll never find out.

I told him I fell down the stairs

I told my boss it was my dog

&#x200B;

But the truth is

I was with you

Drunk and overzealous

Desperately trying to recreate our first night

when we watched the waves crash over our toes

When you held me steady

Called me ""sweetheart""

And told me you felt stuck too.

&#x200B;

I know you don't understand why I always take you to the beach.

I suppose I want to pretend we're the only ones in the world for a moment.

But you played along

&#x200B;

I didn't know how permanent

My goodbye was that night

I thought you wanted to run away like me

Escape into the unknown 

Whenever the mood struck 

&#x200B;

On the beach

Alone today

I learned how many jagged rocks are hidden by the tide

And that I was bound to fall.

&#x200B;

I don't believe in bad timing

But you haven't called.

When I get my feet under me

I'll look for you

And maybe this time

You'll jump with me.

Devoid of strife or care,

But when I speak it’s with dismay,

And panic in the air.

The message to convey,

Yet standing there I start to flake,

And fall to disarray.

The adjectives? They shift.

All verbs then run as I’m derailed

By consonental drift.

Then silence falls, as loud as hell,

Behind my teeth it shakes,

I try to scream, to shriek, to yell!

But in the end, I break.

With screens to hide my shame,

I’ll pen these words, lest I draw breath

83|Essay on Sleeping Alone|"    They say it takes 10,000 hours to master something.
    If that is true then I am a master of sleeping alone.
    Nights upon nights of twin mattresses,
    I racked up hours,
    Nine at a time,
    To be the best at being alone.
    I would fill the silence with a fan blowing sweet static into my ear until I slumbered.
    It was perfect.
    Then you ruined it,
    That night I slept wrapped around you,
    I didn't need blankets,
    Your slow, regular breaths were warm enough,
    And the mechanical whir of the fan was replaced by your
    Palpable,
    Heartbeat.
    I thought I had mastered sleeping alone,
    Then in that one night,
    I just forgot how,
    Next to you,
    Near you.

    I saved a message you left me on my answering machine.
    It says:
    ""Hey, I was just thinking of you ... [long pause] ... anyway, call me back when you get the chance, bye.""

    Hearing your voice is the only way I can fall asleep now.

something I was never able to do before.

I am going to unapologetically

this queen sized mattress,

and not concern myself with the idea

that it will be hard to readjust

when someone joins my bed once more.

For the first time, this space

is all mine to enjoy,

because before you slept next to me

so did a different boy.

and before even then,

my mattress was a twin.

So tonight I will gladly sleep alone,

each limb finding a soft home 

in a spacious corner of my bed,

all of the pillows hogged by my head. 

I will slumber in peace, dreaming happily

Because now, for once, my queen sized mattress

fits just one, perfectly.

so now I’m just sitting here getting half of my work done

while the other half is spent looking at the dust

I’ll be more productive at night, it’s too bright

there’s no clouds in the sky and the end of the road is melting

I think I stepped on a needle at the beach and I can’t stop worrying

I’m trying to finish reading the book you suggested

but I keep re-reading the same page

Now my car won’t start because someone said “ya-know, mercury *is in* retrograde.”

101|Closet|"I can still smell the organic dark roast

Trader Joe's coffee my best friend's stepmom

would brew every morning


It was bitter, and strong, and dark, and rich,

And she told us she wished she had married

A man who was more like her coffee


Never too sweet, because that always fades,

“Marry for money, at least it will last,”

she said, as we pulled away from the big house that she hated


While she wore a big shiny ring that confirmed

that her husband didn't listen

 when she told him what she learned about blood diamonds

in that documentary she watched alone.


I never could tell when people were lying

But she couldn't even fool me

even the self-obsessed, fifteen-year-old version of me


noticed, if only then, the pile she balanced

Haphazardly on her shoulders

of broken marriage fragments,

and I realized

That finding real love in this world was going to be very hard


but I wanted to shake her

to call out her lies

and jump out of the new SUV

with the automatic doors and DVD player

that I knew she wished was smaller

and conserved gas


and I wonder if I should have told her

she didn't have anyone fooled.

The responses here have given me courage to move past this obstacle and I had a wonderful weekend feeling very loved by my spouse and by the world in general.

I hope this poem helps whoever reads it. I’m leaving it as-is because I like the rawness and that it’s far from perfect. I am of the belief that my best poetry comes when I write it just for me. My other work is structured, tight and heavily edited because it’s written to make other people happy. This was written to make me happy, and it’s not perfect or technically sound, but it does what I want it to do.

Thanks again.

————————————

_I Hate Sex, a poem_

I no longer wish you would push me

up against the wall 

and ravish me

right after work. 

-

Which is all well and good 

because

you never wanted to anyway.

-

I no longer want to try new things

in new places

in the safety of your arms.

-

Which is fine

because

your hesitation brings me pain.

-

It used to sadden me,

not being enough,

to make you feel safe 

and secure enough to try. 

But I’ve learned that 

we can’t be everything 

for each other.

-

I denied for a while,

that I would have to give up

on becoming the sexual woman 

I’d hoped to. 

The one finally free 

to explore herself;

within the holy bonds of marriage.

-

Finally safe. 

Finally clean.

-

It hurt so badly to think 

I had set her loose

only to watch her 

beat her wings 

against the bars of larger cage.

-

Over and over

I nursed her wounds,

and she would try to fly again. 

-

Over and over

she fell.

-

Until finally

I asked her:

Please stop trying.

-

I’m embarrassed to admit

I mourned her loss of flight. 

-

Pridefully, 

I discouraged her

pathetic attempts to spread her wings. 

-

Stop it

I told her. 

-
 
You will hurt him 

and 

he cares for us. 

-

Watch how he tries.

It’s not his fault. 

He does not deserve to share our pain. 

We know

how much it hurts to change.

-

Feebly,

I tried to protect him

from her demands.

-

My only pride came 

from seeing those wings 

tucked neatly against her back. 

-

I pinned them there myself

with words so harsh,

and scathing eyes

full of disdain.

-

When she reached upward

arms and wings,

my heart sank

fearful for her pain 

and our shared disappointment.

-

Why doesn’t he want me?

She would cry aloud

whenever I shared his bed.

-

I tried to shut her up, 

so I could sleep.

But she fluttered,

and fretted,

incessantly.

-

Until I was forced to shake him awake. 

-

Why don’t you want me?

Her words 

tumbled out of 

My mouth. 

-

IT ISN’T TRUE.

I tried to scream. 

-

But I couldn’t. 

She had stolen 

My breath 

and 

My voice.

-

His soothing words calmed her. 

I felt life breathed back into to me

My lungs filled themselves

with air 

in greedy snatches. 

-

I’m sorry. 

I tell him, 

myself,

when I am in control again.

-

I’m so sorry I woke you. 

I know you need to sleep. 

I don’t want to cause you sorrow.

-

His eyes are sad 

and his voice husky. 

He thinks he’s let me down.

-

It makes me hate her 

even more. 

I decide 

I need to kill her. 

So that she can no longer

Cause my loved one pain.

-

I watch,

disgusted.

I witness her gazing

beyond her confines. 

-

I am transfixed 

and horrified 

because she imagines

soaring through other skies.

-

How dare you?

I think,

when she confides in me 

that she drifts to sleep at night 

imagining herself in the arms 

Of a hungry man. 

-

It does not help 

or make it okay

that he is no one in particular

or that he doesn’t actually exist. 

-

Nor does it help

that he is never mine,

because fantasizing about him,

the one she truly loves,

stirs her awake too much inside. 

-

It does not matter. 

-

I tell her:

You are filthy. 

You are greedy. 

You are wrong.

-

She retreats

sad, 

knowing I am right.

-

But I do not end her dreams.

-

I let them happen,

because they keep her quiet. 

Oh! Lord! is she quiet!

It is a shameful victory.

-

I isolate myself. 

Close her away. 

Pray to fill her void

-

with children 

and noise 

and a busy home.

-

But when the quiet comes, 

I live in fear of her."

110|I think of you in the morning|"I wake up and taste poetry in my mouth,

and that's how I know I have 

been dreaming about you again.

There are a thousand planets living in between your eyelashes alone,

but I promise not to love you like you are my 

universe.

It would be dishonest,

and you probably deserve better than that.

My mother keeps asking me

why I'm peeling my lips away

to get rid of a name

I've never kissed,

and I still don't have an answer for her yet.

I stopped playing piano in the seventh grade

when my hands started shaking so badly,

I thought they were drunk.

I look for you in raining sunsets 

and flowers on other girl's doorsteps.

I can't tell if you are there or not.

I have never asked anyone to stay before,

but that doesn't mean 

I don't cry when they leave. 

I spend a lot of time writing about people who can't remember

the color of my eyes,

and maybe I should keep things

like that to myself.

We aren't meant to be together in this lifetime,

so we'll have to try again in the next one.

You have to promise me you'll be waiting 

because I don't think I can lose you like this 

again.

There's only so much poetry 

I can write about your hands

before I start to forget 

what your love line looks like

and where it leads to.

I've been telling myself this whole time

that it was leading to me. 

Maybe I've been wrong.

Please tell me I'm not wrong."

When she kisses your neck, it’s no longer muscle and bone and skin.    She’s turned it into a sonnet of rushing rivers    A-B-A-B    C-D-C-D    E-F-E-F    Where every stressed syllable is a kiss upon your jaw    And the unstressed ones are fingertips sinking into your chest    G-G    
    
The poet will drag haikus out of your eyes    How they are green like patches of overwatered grass    And tell stories of centuries come to pass.    17 syllables on how you are so young and yet seem ancient like the great kings of old.    

Don’t sleep with a poet.    She will write pages of odes about your mouth on her thighs    And how your lips trail like a comet down her calves.    

She’ll turn you inside out and take away     everything that makes you alive.    You’ll forget you were ever anything but words scrawled onto scrap pieces of paper.

116|First Poem I've written in a while. I appreciate all feedback, especially the very hash kind!|"I know a structure

Built atop a round marble base,

Surrounded by columns

That hold a dome against the sky.

&#x200B;

It is a finite place

Built on an endless plain.

And under its dome,

Is a timeless wishing well.

&#x200B;

She’s there, standing in front of the well

And facing the horizon.

Her back is turned to me,

Familiar and unknowable.

&#x200B;

Her Elysian figure is

Draped in a thin teal dress,

And Her long golden hair

Falls in delicate curls.

&#x200B;

I step into the marble building

And approach her,

As one always does.

I come just beyond arm’s reach,

&#x200B;

And then she walks in an endless circle.

I follow her forever.

Our path bounded within the columns,

Around and around the wishing well.

&#x200B;

With each lap under the dome,

The circle slowly closes.

Gravity draws us to the center,

And after forever, we arrive at the well.

&#x200B;

And then there is no she nor I.

There is only a wishing well,

Unfathomably deep,

Beneath Eternity’s dome.

&#x200B;

117|Lamentation for a ruined jacket|"""Run!"" she says, and you do;  
hand in shaking hand,  
her laughter holding back the rain  
better than this, your most handsome coat.  

The fairground lights are roses, whirling by  
and in the shelter of the ferris wheel  
a small boy holds a giant bear;  
disbelieving, overjoyed, at what he has won.

A bus is pulling in just beyond the gate,  
but instead of relief, you taste despair.  
You wished this night would never - 

&nbsp;

end. At last. You take your coat from the breakroom.  
The winter months are here in earnest,  
but the dark walk home reminds you of a carnival.  
That fairground is long dismantled,  
but together you have built your own;  
two young lovers in a city flat.  
  
You pass a restaurant, its lonely owner  
hoping to entice a customer in from the cold.  
The aroma, brighter than the light, spills into the street,  
but reality cannot taste as sweet as the idea.  
You head on for -

&nbsp;

Home. Nothing like the tiny flat, all but forgotten  
in the busy lives of two important people.  
Her smile is nervous, her questions desperately casual.  
Unseen, on your shoulder,  are two long, blonde hairs;  
camouflaged against your most handsome coat.

You fidget with a sheet of bubble wrap,  
discarded with the day's mail.  
Taking unconscious pleasure  
in each unthinking, tiny act of -

&nbsp;

Destruction. An ornate mirror  
(four thousand dollars, a wedding present)  
is shattered in the entry hall.  
Over one bannister, the tattered remains  
of a wardrobe;  started with scissors,  
finished with tears.

She stands at the top of the stairs.  
Jaw set firm, but one hand still shaking,  
and holding a phone; on the screen,  
a woman holds a smiling child.

Her mouth is closed,  
her lips are tight,  
but her eyes still speak.  
""Run!"" she says; and you do.

how many calories in a blade of grass?

a heavy thought to bear on my skinny arms and shoulders

its weight could push me down to the cold, shaky ground

and i cannot help but wonder of the number.

but maybe the grass should be concerned

how many calories are in a seventeen year old girl.

120|When I was 11 [Just Sharing]|"When I was 11 

I made love in your classroom

It was the first time for me 

and not the first for you

I was a boy you see 

I was willing to give

What you took from me

I was scared and so were you

but the sound of sirens didn't make me jump

I was a boy 

who didn’t know 

yet you came to me

and made a man of me

When I was 11

You took my virginity

The sound of bells on the hour

were the background to skin on skin

They were the clock to our sins

I am grown now 

and the sounds of bells 

bring me back to your classroom

There I am a boy becoming a man

There you became a part of me

Now I am 30

I make love in my own bedroom

and the sounds of bells still get to me

it was the squeaking of chairs 

and scratches on chalkboards

that are the sounds of my PTSD

When it got awkward

I felt trapped by you

The thumbs ups 

and congratulatories by my classmates

couldn't hide the wrong I felt

“teacher's pet” 

couldn’t properly describe my cage

I was “lucky” to get it so young

The wise sex guru to all who asked

a master among my class…

but that didn't last 

when I was 11 

I was raped in your classroom

You took advantage of my naivety

I was the victim of your depravity

I can still hear the bells 

the clock to our sins 

skin on skin 

and the sirens as they took you in

121|i probably shouldn't be with you|"
A heartbeat is like a never-ending stampede of buffalo,   
hooves crushing sandstone into the ground,   
fur knotted, necks coated with a thick film of sweat;  
they run faster when there’s danger.   
   
   &nbsp;  
  
Sometimes I hate looking at you because your eyes  
are unknown minerals,  
impossible to grasp,  
set perfectly in the museum of your face   
behind oversized, dark frames.   
I wish I wasn’t above burglary.    
  
  &nbsp;  
  
My buffalo are tired 
and they’re running straight from the burning coals of hell  
into your arms and I can’t seem to figure out  
if they’re tearing their hair out with their teeth     
or getting a cool drink of water.   
  
&nbsp;
  
I’m struggling to accept that the marble of your skin     
might have red veins of granite next time I hold you;   
but I’ve never actually gotten the chance to hold you   
so I call myself a failure and try to shoot my ghosts   
in the head.    
  
  &nbsp;

I’ve been thinking about you during long car rides,   
the roadkill and the pines sliding from my rearview mirror   
into the horizon.   
I hope you think about me sometimes.    
  
  &nbsp;  

I wonder if I’ll kiss you,    
our lips soaked with each other,    
we’re dripping like peach juice down the maroon walls    
of the passion we’ve created,     
Will you feel anything with my fingers on your waist?   
  
&nbsp;  
  
I’m loading up a shotgun,   
shells copper and iron and plastic,   
staring at my herd.   

&nbsp;  

I can’t help but question  
if the saying “kill your darlings”   
rings true,  
so I’m pacing, pondering, folding into myself,   
asking the world to send a sign   
because I’m awfully lost and could really use   
a “get out of my own fucking head” card.

From the hour we tumbled through that slender strait  
Never will I touch the parting of your thighs

Sweet boy, to grasp you as my nymph-like prize  
Will send me straight into to the raving state  
One inch closer and the whole world dies

A lust to unfasten life’s short, golden plait  
Never will I touch the parting of your thighs

that struck me, hexed me, made my mind gyrate)  
But one inch closer and the whole world dies

Across the clear-eyed gulf I did create  
Never will I touch the parting of your thighs

i hide myself behind a microphone

In my sea 



Yet love has never 

Washed upon my beaches

Hasn’t risen to be seen 



Do I 

blame the plague 

of risks not taken 

Greed of inevitability 



Has the wind of time 

Gone by and forgotten about me 



Fight I try 

Against a world

Spinning into madness 



Fire spits its lovely sin

Stains my lips in sadness

Deeper than before 



Cursed in ash 

Covered in soil 

Damned with 

The same weight as before

The funeral of us was too quick.  

&nbsp;  

They preserved your body  
as I wandered the midnight earth.   
Vodka, lemon juice, brine.  
My room smelled like you for days.  

&nbsp;  

It took me one month to return  
one more to dig.  

&nbsp;

I finally removed the leaves.  
Peeled back decayed oak,  
raked maple,  
plucked pine needles  
from your chest.  
Roots and mycelium brushed to oblivion.   
(Still I say nothing of the thorns.)  

&nbsp;  

You were this autumn husk to dissect  
and a pile of unraveled tapes  
of the oldest science.  

&nbsp;  

I opened your sternum like a book I knew.  
All heat was gone.  

&nbsp;  

A burst of flies came forth  
from eggs I had planted in you  
when we were just starting.  

&nbsp;  

I have taken them back.  
I have removed their wings,  
pinned their bodies  
straight through the heart  
into black felt.  
I have pierced them.  
Now everything is aligned, but  
I cannot fill.  
Cannot believe anymore.  

&nbsp;  

The shadowbox of your personality  
was empty from the start.

I'm sorry this happened. I know it's not fair.

If you're alone and standing, I suggest you grab a chair.

Offering the crutch that feeds your insecurities.

You're stuck with me, try to scream away the memories. 

Gnaw, gnash, fight and flail; I'll make you wish there was a hell.

Go ahead, run, it's what you always do. 

With a hollow grin and reminiscent smile, I'll be waiting.

We both know they can't, who are we kidding?

I'm not so bad, am I? Feel that happiness? It's only temporary. 

That laughter; clearly obscurity.

Stalking my prey is the technique I contour to.

Running away with no destination in sight. 

C'mon, slow down, don't be impolite. 

You can run for a while, but I always catch up. 

We both know what happens when your mental legs give up.

&#x200B;

Shhh... don't be scared. Trust me, I won't leave. 

I whisper your faults until you break down and grieve. 

It's okay, cry, it might provide some relief. 

But we both know that relief is always so brief.

&#x200B;

You try to suppress me with your drugs and hobbies.

Good luck, I'm real. I'm not the fucking Jabberwocky. 

&#x200B;

I'll leave you with some words that may provide alleviation.

I'm inside of everyone; just look around and see my manifestation.

136|Here We Go Again|" oh here we go again.

same tears, same pain, same pen

writing down the words i wish i could say

to you, hoping the anger would go away

i have a feeling it won't

i give you chances to redeem yourself, you don't

i know i should be supportive in your time of need

but when i see you with her, i fill up with greed

and i wish i wasn't as nice as i was

and that you would care more than it shows because

i want to be your friend, i really do

but sometimes i wonder what you would think

if i crushed my love, and hurt you too.

&#x200B;

I caught a glimpse of myself in a distant mirror

in my high-waisted pants and thought

""Maybe I am not fat.""

&#x200B;

I will force myself not to see the tangles in my unbrushed ponytail

by not lingering in the mirror

searching for guilt in the peaks and valleys

and lipsuction for the neck

I will not scrutinize the jagged bits of fingernails and polish

that I have not yet managed to tear off

I will not scrape the oil from my skin with rigid objects and inspect it with disgust

wondering how my body could betray me again

&#x200B;

Today, I will not search for flaws

I will acknowledge the harsh voices

and politely dismiss them

I might only be beautiful during this five second breath

But I will allow this temporary acceptance to water the seeds of kindness I have planted

and pray they bloom.

138|We call her beautiful|"We call the sun

Beautiful

She is a life giver

The warmest eye to look upon me.

She will burn you

Down to bone.

Then to nothing.

We call the sun

Radiant

An unmerciful mother

We bask in her beauty too long and become hephaestus.

Love me mother with my wounds weeping.

Warm me until my bones crack and splinter. My muscle and blood become dust.

Love me how I know to be loved.

With pain. With hunger.

Love me mother as the cat loves the bird.

Until you catch me.

And consume me.

Love me so completely that there is nothing left.

We call the sun

Beautiful.

And maybe beauty is 

as the saying goes

pain

Or

Maybe the sun is

God.

Because I have tried to see her.

And I always feel my eyes burning.

Hot in their sockets.

139|Airing out my dirty laundry|"You are my dirty laundry. 
The shirt I wore over and over again,
always putting off washing,
for you were once my favorite shirt to wear. 
But times change. 

You are my dirty laundry. 
I find myself tossing you into my washing pile,
Hiding you away deep down .
I can't bring myself to wash or wear you anymore. 
There is more to my wardrobe. 

You are my dirty laundry. 
I’ve found other clothes that fit me,
That are new and clean,
That make me feel beautiful. 
And it’s no longer you. 

You are my dirty laundry. 
It’s not until I finally do my laundry,
that I finally feel you are gone. 
For once my clothes are clean,
Your scent that comes with so many memories goes away. 

You are my dirty laundry. 
Because even after being washed,
some stains and holes remain. 
And looking past them is hard. 
I still can't bring myself to wear you. 

You are my dirty laundry. 
But not for much longer, hopefully. 
You deserve to be worn by someone who looks past those tears and stains
Who complements your colors and prints better than I can,
which is why I'm giving you away. 

You were my dirty laundry, but I’m not ashamed. 
I’ll always remember how good we used to look,
and I’ll cherish our times, when you fit my body like a glove. 
But sometimes clothes go out of season and bodies change.
And now, I am drawn to a new statement piece.

140|Old Feelings|"I revisited old feelings;

I learned that they do not live there anymore.

I spent hours and hours looking for them

in the way you talked

and smiled

and laughed.

I wasted the night away trying to coax them back.

_

As the first alarm went off,

I was ready to leave for home.

I used to wish you would stay;

you used to be my home,

my special place.

_

As we parted ways,

traces of you lingered--

the smell of your skin

and the smile on your face

imprinted in my memory--

but the shadows of the old feelings

have gone away.

142|I thought acid would cure my depression|"Thoughts

Swimming around like crocodiles

In denial, in reform

Smoking reefer to re-form this brain

I refer my fame to the drain

Pour out the pain

.

Ostracize myself, elephant in the room

Nobody speaks about me or to

Me, alone in my gloom

Mr. solo

Don't know

How to speak

I peaked in 1st grade

Depressed since then

Repressed a thousand grins

I digress, I press this knife to my chest

And dive in

.

I'm a crocodile

Swimming through thoughts

Devouring each one

Like goldfish

During a smoke-sesh

On the couch, so lazy

Fat croc now satiated

Hazed and half dead

Half crazy, so mad

Red as the devil

Smoke pouring

Down my throat

Like wine

.

And I plug in the line

Let the music flow

Bicycles for two

But I'm isolated

Faded, silently

Screaming for Mother

Don't go, Daddy

Come home

.

But it's too late now

I've let it all go

Poured acid on this

Plastic contraption

Let it melt into a rainbow

God's promise

That he told me

He would tell

If I would let myself fall

So I did and all I found

Was darkness

At the bottom

Of this well

.

&nbsp;  
&nbsp;  
&nbsp;

The needle won't reach the record,

And my brain can't reach around,  
Why his warmth didn't reach inside.

Now I'm reaching out for answers,  
From a boy inside a box  
Who couldn't reach the record,  
And could only see the stop.  
&nbsp;  
Reaching out for freedom,  
He sang a final song.  
He floated out of reach-  
Drowned his demons in the dawn.  
&nbsp;  
Now we reach for what to say,  
When the silence is too strong.  
But nothing seems to reach.  
Forever is too long.

147|Antigone|"*She tread barefoot over cracked cobblestone, and the snow crystals clung to her like prayers. I asked why she bowed her head and she answered, He will only recognize us for the backs of our necks. But when I kissed her, she tasted of salted earth and embers, and when I bit her she did not bleed.*

&#x200B;

\~

&#x200B;

my father told me

Watch your tongue

&#x200B;

so I learned to swallow bitterness

and suck honey-flavored coughdrops

&#x200B;

with split lips.

A mother without a son is still a mother.

&#x200B;

David, you are one-armed hugs and alarm clocks,

needles, smudged fingerprints, long letters home.

&#x200B;

Every love poem I have ever written is for missing you.

She tucks us in and sings

&#x200B;

the same songs that she made love to,

broke bread and cut hair to,

&#x200B;

and I only learned how to kiss

with a knife between my teeth.

&#x200B;

Sometimes I wonder if she is sorry.

A sister without a brother is still a child.

*She combed the leaves from her hair and took my hand and placed it on her breast. Her heartbeat was a promise I wanted to believe but couldn't. I asked, what is brave about silence? The sky leaned in to listen. Her smile swallowed me whole.*

The morning would whip the covers

from our bodies

like the sound of breaking glass,

&#x200B;

and we were not dead yet,

fastening our hands to our wrists

with red ribbons covered in the word

&#x200B;

Apology. We learned to crawl

on broken kneecaps

to the arms holding the hammer

&#x200B;

and whole years would disappear

into the cavernous expanse

of a hungry man's throat.

&#x200B;

How could we not crave loneliness

when recognition was finding

your own scars on the palms of another,

&#x200B;

your own blood soaking,

stinking, drenching,

the sand beneath a lover's feet?

&#x200B;

\~

&#x200B;

*She asks, have you not learned to be humble? Stones fall from the chimney and she shapes them into a throne. I want to tell her that the secret to life is not dying. Instead I cut my nipple and bleed forgiveness into her. I hold her until she falls asleep.*

&#x200B;

\~

&#x200B;

on the first morning after my death

I awoke colorless.

&#x200B;

Every day since then,

I have eaten handfuls of apple seeds

&#x200B;

and scrubbed my face with pine needles,

bathed in dark wines and sipped

&#x200B;

gasoline. All this to say -

I am not sorry

&#x200B;

for dancing at your funeral.

I must keep on

&#x200B;

with living

until this heart can sleep.

157|I Wrote This One To Impress You|"I

With my vivacious verbs

My profound nouns

Wrote this poem with the singular intention

Of inciting a chorus of “Oooh” and “Ahhh”

As you scan the page

I want to see your eyes ignite with wonder

Swell with meaning

Leak with sentiment

After all, that’s why I wrote this poem

Maybe when you finish reading

You’ll look up

Say something like,

“I’ve never known this side of you.”

Or

“I’m so touched…”

Or even better

Maybe you’ll let the page fall from your hands

And wordlessly sink into my arms

…is what I think as I write this poem

But you won’t do any of that

No tears

No swooning

Because I didn’t show you this poem

How could I?

You’d just look at me with an empty smile

“It’s nice.” you’d say as you hand the page back to me

That’s what you do with every poem

I ever wrote to impress you

158|lustful bastard|"It’s 3:00am 

and I should have gone to sleep

3 and a half hours ago,

but instead I’m talking to this guy.

&nbsp;

This guy with dead green eyes

and slicked back hair,

with straight teeth 

and long legs.

&nbsp;

He gets it.

&nbsp;

At least, I think he does;
             
maybe I just want him to.

&nbsp;

He’s a sweet kisser

when he’s sober 

and leaves bruises on my thighs

after a couple beers. 

&nbsp;

I don’t mind;

&nbsp;

he’s good company and doesn’t 

care that I’m hurting because he 

doesn’t care about much and I 

don’t want to care about anything

at all.

&nbsp;

But when we’re in his bed

and he turns away from me,

instead of sleeping 

I connect the freckles on his back,

creating constellations

out of tiny brown birthmarks.

&nbsp;

He is beautiful,

and as I trace his skin 

with my fingers,

I feel a little more at home,

more than I have in a long time.

&nbsp;

But then he sits up 

and reminds me that he doesn’t care

and I remember that I don’t care either.

&nbsp;

I walk home

fighting the crisp autumn air 

and make myself toast 

in an empty kitchen 

and hit my head

on an open 

cupboard 

and all I can see are stars.

I can earnestly delight in you again.

Shake the dust from your bones.

Swipe the dirt off that suit.

Wipe the streams from your widow’s eyes.

&#x200B;

Stand up, Old Man.

There isn't much time before the earth takes you back.

Force your casket top off.

Rip out the nails that dare to hold you down.

Your shoulders were always so strong,

The first to carry my tears was you.

Please, Old Man, there is still too much rain on sunny days.

This is the only thing I’ve ever begged of you.

&#x200B;

Stand up, Old Man.

Tear the shovel out of your brother's hands,

I’ve never seen something that heavy.

You always wanted to be buried with your flag,

But flags are meant to fly freely in the wind.

Not be folded and caged for the dirt.

The muskets are sounding their destitute cry.

Measuring the loud seconds you lay there,

Choosing the Earth’s embrace.

165|do you drink to forget him?|"“you seem to drink alcohol a lot,” my therapist speaks with hooded eyes over a ratty notebook. “do you drink to forget him?”

oh but i do a lot to forget him. i kiss boys that i don’t know because they taste of cigarette like him. i do a lot worse than kiss because i don’t want the last person to be in me to be him. but he always is. he’s always in me. when i buy my groceries at 2pm, when i gag over the toilet at 3am. he’s all i know.

it’s ironic, really. i wish i drank to forget him, but in incoherence it stands the same that all i can think about is him. when the party draws in and my world is spinning his name flashes like a broadway show on the front page of my mind. when it’s the middle of the night and i’m emptying the poisonous contents of my stomach, i see our past in the remnants. my pupils are dilated to hell and i can see his face in the black.

if i’m drinking to forget him, it’s not working. how do you forget someone who became a part of you? someone who became the oxygen you breathe, the liquid in your bloodstream?

166|206: The bruises have healed and I am no longer stardust (#metoo)|"At 8 years old, you get your hair pulled on the   playground and you're told, ""he likes you""  
At 13 you hear your classmates telling rape jokes,     
 the teacher shrugs and says ""boys will be boys""  
So you never leave your drink unattended or go to the   restroom alone at night and  
at 21 you no longer wear skirts to the parties  
you used to enjoy so much.


I swear you didn't even notice the day  
that the whistles and cat calls faded,  
became background static,  
because you have always been  
too goddamn polite.


I promised myself I would not be defined by the  
amount of times someone elses hands  
met with my once-withered body  
I will not care whether or not he misses me when he   is alone at night. 


But the first time a man grabbed me by the hair   
and called me a slut,   
No, I did not run  
I stayed for 2 years and called it love  
Until the day I just couldn't keep  
the blood inside my wrists anymore,  
No, he did not want to clean up this mess.

167|Not Her|"You squeezed me in your sleep and said “I love you, baby.” I don't even think you realize you did it.
You were dreaming you were with her again.


The sparkly, white motorcycle helmet, the yang to your matching black helmet, sits dusty in the garage.


We kiss with an intimacy that feels real, but not ours. Something grown with someone else and placed on someone new to fill the void.


A dozen red roses, once vibrant and soft, rest in a vase on your dresser, long since dried.


You ask me to scratch your head, but I know I don't do it like she did.
I'm not like her.

You told me you don't want to be manipulated.
But I'm not like her.


“Out of the blue.”
I'm sure there were warning signs.
Or she was too scared to let on she was leaving.
Did she have enough or are you this way because no one can ever live up to her?


But I am doing the same to you. And my shared side of the intimacy was also grown with someone else.
And I am just as scared of you, as you are of me.
Because you're like him.

You remind me of all the good parts of him and feeling in love. But you remind me of all the bad parts too.

Maybe I am like her.

Or maybe I'm more like you?

""This is the worst ginger ale I've had in my life""

I said to the white walls and fluorescent lights

A record-setting breakdown, achieving the impossible

Shooting for the moon and landing in the hospital - 

&nbsp;

Picking at the bracelet that bore my name and ""21M""

Waiting for a mediocre meal that never even came

Noticing the dirt and grime covering the floors

I suddenly felt an irreversible shame

The shame

of my roommate escorting me to the psych center

Making sure I didn't walk into oncoming traffic

The shame

of having to explain to my parents that every girl

I ever loved has turned out to be an addict

The shame

of wanting to fuck the therapist, because sex

is the only thing that makes me feel anymore

The shame

The shame, the shame of it all tore

me to bits and the next hours blurred:

Forms.

Urine samples.

Blood tests.

Questionnaires.

Diagnoses.

Discharge.

&nbsp;

Words.

&nbsp;

I remembered my father's words as I put on my sweater

He said ""Son, sometimes life doesn't get any better""

Now it's time, once again, to get it all back in order

Even though heartbreak is waiting just around the corner

The moment you confided in me, my beautiful friend

The truth broke me in half, and now it has to end

And as I sit in my room with the indigo walls

The lights are off and this ginger ale tastes

like

nothing at all.

178|poolside convo about estrangement|"I’m sitting on the hood of my car  
next to a groaning, fenced off field of cows  
wondering if you’d feel like a failure  
if my death was un-televised.  
  
&nbsp;  
  
Would you still care  
if I came home with no gold trophies in my bag,  
no bills in my wallet?  
Just scars on my neck and secrets I’ll never tell you.  

&nbsp;  

I couldn’t blame you if you didn’t.  
I forget exactly when you told me that lying was wrong   
so I’ll use that as justification   
to sneak out in the middle of the night,   

&nbsp;  
 
splay out on the backseat of a Toyota   
like the messiah of the misfits.  
I tear my clothes off like superman,  
humiliate myself then blame the Uber driver.   

&nbsp;  

We used to watch beauty broadcasted,  
curled up on the couch, I giggled about dragons, monsters;  
googly-eyed over the most expansive, orange tinted valleys  
that the Discovery Channel could find.   

&nbsp;  

I traded my PJs for joggers,  
my light up Sketchers for Nikes,  
the Wiggles for Brockhampton,   
your dreams for my own.   

&nbsp;  

Were we adventurers?     
Or were we fascinated by an idea of a glory   
that I was too young to grasp and    
you were too old to find again.     

&nbsp;  


 While you were covering up your wrinkles with discolored makeup,   
I was counting every hair on my chest.  
While you shunned yourself for gaining a pound,  
I ate three cheeseburgers and congratulated my stomach for growing so big.   

&nbsp;  

 The tv’s volume is down.  
Your head is locked on your computer  
while my hand is white-balled into a fist  
and you’re telling me that I’m disrespectful.  

&nbsp;  

I’m telling you that I just want to be normal.  
We both dodge the fact that you never wanted me to be normal.  
We have different definitions of greatness.  
Unless I drown, your lungs will never be filled.

180|Raindrop|"what does a raindrop see  
when it's being hurled to the surface of the earth at twenty miles an hour?  

because i'm falling down  
from the thirtieth story of this building  
and honestly, it's all a blur

how does a raindrop keep its composure  
when it's due to hit concrete in seconds?

how does it keep from screaming like i'm doing --  
or, at least trying to --  
i can't make much sound when the air is stuffing my lungs.

does the droplet's life flash before its eyes?  
does it remember its adiabatic birth?  
could it recognize its origin tempest?

maybe it doesn't have to  
because it knows the impact won't be its end  
for isn't all rain recycled?

i wonder if i'll be reborn  
maybe the next incarnation won't jump.

182|Never Fall in Love With a Poet|"#Never Fall in Love With a Poet


It's a dangerous business,  
falling in love with a poet.  

&nbsp;  
We are like whirlpools.  
We are gaping, angry black holes  

&nbsp;  
in the fabric of things.  
We will grasp at anything  

&nbsp;  
beautiful enough to fall  
into our orbit, and consume you  

&nbsp;  
whole, grinning and licking  
our hungry, love-chapped lips.   

&nbsp;  
Eager for the next morsel…   
the next flimsy ship to wander   

&nbsp;   
into our unlucky embrace.  
We will wring you out, squeezing   

&nbsp;   
you like suede deerskin,   
panning your bones for gold pebbles  

&nbsp;   
which we wear like trophies.   
And even if you leave,   

&nbsp;   
the places where we once resonated,   
you and I, will hum and hiss and warble   

&nbsp;   
through the air, an endless distress call:   
Mayday, mayday: here be dragons.

183|The last swim. (haiku)|"Midsummer sunset

184|A poem for my wounded lover that probably deserves more than this poem|"I was 22 when we first met,   
Raw skin still tingling   
where I had ripped off the band-aid  
Of a former lover’s embrace.   
You were 31.  
Convinced I was the healing tonic   
To finally quell that fiery ache   
burning like bile in your throat.  

&nbsp;

I was unsure, skeptical of your certainty.  
But there was solace in your closeness,  
As I drank you in with tiny sips   
From a sterile plastic cup.

&nbsp;  

With time, your touch became a familiar ointment  
against my old bruises,  
Your words became soft cotton,  
And your tongue sterilized my open cuts   
That still refuse to heal.  
We have leaned against each other, these five years,  
Our entanglement a crutch for limping strides,  
An affectionate anesthetic numbing already dulled pains.  


&nbsp;

But my body is not a tonic.  
Or a bandage,  
Or a salve.  
I am not a pill to be swallowed with patient gulps.  


&nbsp;

*I cannot heal you.*

&nbsp;

This was only temporary relief.  
A palliative mistaken for a cure,  
A comforting togetherness   
that has grown into dependency,  
And as I feel myself liquidated into a syrup   
Depleting with each of your measured doses,  
I long for the solidity of solitude.  

&nbsp;

Tend to your wounds, lover,  
And I’ll tend to mine.  
Your restoration cannot be found here,  
Your remedy lies behind someone else’s flesh.

Do you think she stands there just because she can?  
To feel the pulling wind of soon arriving trains    
As she balances the tightrope of the platform’s edge    
And sways to echoed vibrations?     


Does she see herself through technicoloured screens?  
Holding court from across the yellow line    
Stretching out to say goodbye     
As an extra in an old war film?   


Or does she teeter on the edge of something else;    
The subtle lure of space between the tracks    
And the gnawing, hungry, vicious biting    
Of her life outside the station?   

I wonder if she feels your stare?    
Feels you cut yourself on her soft edges    
And wonders if you’ll to meet her eyes

apprentices of love

the telephone rings

right through the phone lines  
and land  
on the curve of my hip.  


but tonight  
his voice is small  
and reaching for himself  
instead of me  
because he needs to be held  
more than he needs to hold someone  


I’m asking

hiccup.  
“wa-wanted to be” 


hiccup. 


“a girl sometimes.”   


The last piece of the puzzle leaves dry lips like the quiet squeak of a mouse.

and rivers of light  
flow from under the bathroom door  
make up is scattered  
over the top of my dresser  
blushes  
and lip gloss   
and concealer  
mascaras 


the doorknob turns.  
my love is wearing my sweater  
my favorite pair of jeans  
and a smile as large as Texas. 


there’s kisses  
on the napes of necks,  
tips of fingers,  
tops of heads  
and I catch a whiff of  
cotton candy  
and spearmint.  


i never want,  
that smile to stop blinding me.  
but we both know  
people are more like wolves  
than bunny rabbits,  
and I wish I could do more  
to stop them from devouring you.  
But for now,  
I hope I’m enough  


just to clean out  
the wounds.

Edit: Can’t change the title, but it’s Debilitating  Sleep Schedule now :)

&#x200B;


The clock ticks away,

Tick, tick, tock

Please stop, please God just stop

&#x200B;


Nothing makes sense, I live a good life,

An average middle class citizen,

But still sometimes it’s like,

&#x200B;


Jesus Christ, 

I don’t want to take these pills, 

Washed down with a caffeinated concoction of chemicals,

At eleven o’clock in a city I don’t even live in;

&#x200B;


My shoes feel lived-in, but not by me,

No, some other kid with hopes and dreams,

But now is not the time for these,

&#x200B;


The hopes and dreams, they torture me,

I torture my sheets filled with apathy,

Another thing well lived-in,

&#x200B;


But not by me.

&#x200B;

No, countless others have slept,

In these very same sheets,

I’m sleeping with another man,

Of course not sexually,

&#x200B;


Because why the fuck would I,

Would someone like me,

Even want another person not just inside,

But beside me


&#x200B;

I underscore the serious tones with penis jokes,

For sometimes you see,

I can’t tell who’s talking, 

Is it the pills;

&#x200B;

Or is it me?

Between your weight and a soft couch

As I try to wrestle away

The cigarette you told me not to give you

You hold it just beyond my reach

and with the other arm, hold me in place

like the last time we laid on this couch and you felt a temptation

&#x200B;

“Your boyfriend will smell my cologne on your body,“

You know how he doesn't trust me.”

And you're right, he doesn't.

&#x200B;

Not since that one time

when he found out that “just this once”

you pushed me into the cushions and whispered “our secret”

And then, “just this once,” it had happened again.

&#x200B;

“Look, I want this to be smoked,” you say,

Which is like what you told me

When you said I'd looked lonely,

And you wanted me to be touched.

&#x200B;

“I'll give it to my boyfriend, if that's all it is,”

and still holding me, you admit“

No.  I want to smoke it.”

My face red, blushing from all the attention.

The matching shadow of our eyelashes,

Fall on our cheeks, long like spiders.

He licks his salty lips,

Our feet dangling over a graveyard

Of sunflowers that will never be.

I examine the cracks in his worn leather mitt,

As if I were memorizing each line of his calloused hands.

The wind murmurs secrets into our ears.

He tells me everything I am,

Everything I will be,

And I cocoon myself in every word.

Rose-gold is an ugly color, some candied sunset  
cloying against a cheap sky. Any stone worth its dirt  
has a bit of grit to it and refuses to be an easy carving.  
&nbsp;  
Now marble has never been a stone, and there I find  
the query:  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*what’s hard, and long, and red all over?*  
&nbsp;  
I can’t tell if its war or love or the Rocky Mountains.  
&nbsp;  
I got this chipped premolar that looks just like one,  
jagged and nearly crescent, perfect thing to hang  
the moon off of. Mama loved that red rock (come  
in she just cooked some greens) temple in Indiana  
Jones. That same rose-gold color as the sunset  
for a sweet tooth. I sure do love how its dug into  
a misplaced Rocky. Running my tongue across  
my petral molar I wonder if Mama didn’t chip it  
just so I’d have a place to hide when new teeth burst  
in and the jaw aches with a longing for something,  
anything to get cut out.

(look I still keep the grounds left over from when I was

despite biting and burnt around the edges.

195|The Paradox of Sticky Buns|"**I remember when the world had more vivid colors than it does now.**

When my mother was twice as tall as I was.

When kickball lasted until the streetlights came on

or until someone ran into the tree that we used as home plate

and no one could talk them out of going home.

Sometimes we would come home to sticky buns.

**Warm bread and sticky glaze made for a maple-flavored mess,**

spread across the face and hands of four children.

ALL dirt sticks to children who have just eaten sticky buns.

Dirt or not, I remember the way we looked forward to them.

I also remember the look on my mother's face

every time she made them, as if burdened by a weight

that children were not aware of.

**Many years later, I know how they're made.**

A simple recipe, made for children's taste:

pre-made biscuits (from the cans that explode)

cooked until golden, then drizzled with maple syrup

and left to bake for just a few-  more-       minutes.

The perfect blast of sugar for energy-wasting children.

Such a simple recipe was surely born in desperation. 

In retrospect, I know that look upon my mother's face as pain:

once, in lieu of dinner, she poured syrup over biscuits. 

To cook the only food we had.

Every time we called for sticky buns,

she was reminded of our poverty.


**Yet still she obliged,**

cooking up sticky buns for her kids,

who knew not what poverty meant,

yet were formed under its rule

with sticky hands and dirty faces.

everywhere he goes.

Pieces of bigger things:

the fragments of the whole.

There never was a miracle

too small to behold,

and so he kept every one,

and every one made him bowed.

The others all around him,

seemed happy in their role,

but he knew only backache,

toil, and toll.

He carried his burden,

as vast as he, old.

Too large to conceal,

he never let it go.

**He slept on coin pillows**

the color of mold

and defended his treasure

with a vigor so bold

that ten men together

should endeavor to hold.

**One day while counting,**

the man, in his home,

heard a noise from the ceiling 

that sounded of groan.

He dashed for his pennies,

as groan grew to moan

and was crushed under rains

of money he owed.

202|Untitled|"I am a stripper who shows no skin:

I am a virgin whore,

Trapped in a cycle of addiction to

Self-sabotage.

I bathe in verbal gasoline and

Beckon fire to come near.

I expose my naked soul to all

Who wish to see;

Who wish to harm;

Who wish to control

Me.

My scantily clad mind begs

To be abused

(Some women like it)

To be harassed

(What were you wearing?)

To be reminded that I am

Unlovable,

After all.

I prostitute myself to the voices of

Rage and

Confusion and

Frustration and

Pain

Because it’s easier to be abused

Than it is to understand

Love.

Attention is my

Amphetamine

The catcalls in the street—

Confusion is my

Crack cocaine—

Even though my nose don’t bleed,

And a gas lamp is my

Fentanyl lace

With which I crochet doilies

To decorate the house of my mind

Until I find a home.

Maybe they don’t know that I prefer

Love

Over meth;

Honesty

Over crack;

Safety

Over heroin;

Arms that love;

Words that hold

Me.

Maybe they don’t know that I want

Out

Of darkness

And into the light of Your

Presence;

Let me sun myself in the light

Of Your presence;

Bring color back into the walls

Of my soul;

Let the cold blood of my mind

Flow again and be the only

One who doesn’t let go of

Me.

God,

Please.

“Christmas Prison”

&#x200B;

‘Twas the night before Christmas,

And all through the halls,

The guards dragged their sticks

Across the doors and the walls.

&#x200B;

Then an hour before Christmas,

Eleven to be exact,

The Count was in progress.

There was a flashlight attack.

&#x200B;

They bang our beds, to startle us awake,

Telling us to uncover, it’s important to make

The guards be aware, you are breathing still,

His only invasion, is to know if you are well.

&#x200B;

Their footfalls are noisy, with their keys a-clang,

Their voices are loud, like bells with a bang.

The department keeps us awake with fluorescent lights,

Something old St. Nick would be startled with fright.

&#x200B;

And then there are the searches, throughout the day,

It’s Christmas again, the guards get to play.

They toss all our presents, our lives completely undone,

So they can get double time and have some fun.

&#x200B;

Christmas isn’t Christmas here, it’s just another day,

No lights, no trees, no holiday cheer, no children at play.

Men just wake up to another day lost,

Surrounded by jailers and guards that think they’re the boss.

&#x200B;

Then there are the phone calls

From kids in ecstasy.

When are you coming home, daddy,

To celebrate and be with me.

&#x200B;

I just sit here, tears rolling down my face,

Saying soon—soon—remember to set me a place.

Although in the back of my mind, I have many years to fill,

To give to the state, to repay the till.

&#x200B;

Don’t get me wrong, we all make mistakes,

We run through stop signs, we forget to brake.

And then there are many here, that have done much worse,

They have hijacked our lives, and killed our thirst.

&#x200B;

There are millions of men and women, that upon this Christmas day,

They languish in the prisons, sleeping their lives away.

We should all remember, that we could be there too,

One wrong decision we make, the action we take, our freedom could be through.

&#x200B;

I am one among you, this lesson still rings true,

With all the pain, suffering and time I still have to do.

But I believe in Christmas, its forgiving qualities,

That gives a man a second chance, to live with family.

&#x200B;

All I can say is, keep your life mistake free,

You don’t want to go to prison or to be a casualty.

This never was a good place for people to be,

At Christmas time, or any time, a place without a tree.

205|Indigo|" 

I can't open the box.

In the box, sits three months—  
Three months of hope,  
Three months of planning,  
Three months of congratulations,  
Three months of ""you're going to be great parents,""

Three months of *her*.

And when I look  
At the bend of the bow,  
The tie of the knot,  
The crinkled, colored wrapping,  
I see the crumpled shape  
Of the woman I love,  
Whose love is too great  
To bear.  
I see the weak, wavering smile  
Of the woman I love  
Who worries that I worry  
As she wastes away.

I see love,  
Measured in pain,  
Measured in agony,  
Measured in weeks upon weeks  
Trying to keep *her* healthy  
As the woman I love  
Lives love, breathes love,  
Weaponizes love,  
Fighting her body at every turn  
For *her*.

And I'm afraid, that my tears  
Will shatter the remnants  
Of our broken family.  
So I pick up the pieces,  
I snatch up the future,  
And I pack, carefully.

I tuck the corners around  
Fifty years of struggling,  
Of cakes, and arguments,  
Of sense and nonsense,  
Folding, and creasing, and smoothing,  
Until, from the outside,  
It just looks like a box.

*—We dreamt of a lifetime*  
And came home with a box.

Yes, the cows disapprove of us, my love.   


They watch with narrowed bovine eyes   
as your fingers interlace with mine.  
They look up haughtily from their cud,   
mouths slack in good Christian horror   
at the brash way we speak in wordless glances.   


Yes, even cows would never dare   
to use their tongues to speak those saccharine words of devotion,   
Or wrap their virtuous lips   
around the moistened paper of your cigarette   
after a long day of longing.   


That guttural lowing could never harmonize   
with the deep richness of your voice.  
And those churning, chambered stomachs   
could never fill with the butterflies   
that flutter against the lumps in our throats.  


Hold me, woman.   
Give me the deepest depths of your humanity,   
Let me make a home in your intoxicating forever   
Until the cows come to tear it down.

210|A Place to Remember|"    I think our minds, like many things, are limited in space,
    our thoughts and things we like to know all need their proper place.
    Although our minds are vastly wide, they really aren’t that deep
    so we must choose from what must go and what we want to keep.

    I like to save a little space for all my favourite songs,
    like “In the Mood,” and “Cross Road Blues,” or “Where my heart belongs.”
    I also like to save some room for Riddles to recite,
    that way I can solve them quick so others think I’m bright.

    I put aside a tiny space for how food made me feel,
    the taste, the scent, the honesty of hearty home-cooked meals.
    I can’t forget the way you used to dance around and bake,
    And every year without a word, we’d have my favourite cake.

    I may be old but I recall the plot of your first book,
    Where Mary fell in love with Henry Gimble’s Pastry Cook 
    I also have a corner kept for all the art you drew,
    I always liked the one you did of Howard feeling blue.

    And last I have the biggest part saved for the thought of you,
    You may be gone but I recall the life we have been through
    You were my wife, my love & life the day that we first met, 
    I can't recall the world and more, but you I can’t forget.

212|La Petite Mort|"Sweet Nothing once again draws near,

she pours sweet nothings in my ear:

a promise to relieve my pain

if in her bed I will remain.

An icy hand to soothe my brow;

she knows that I am listening now,

and trails a finger down my cheek,

voice like poison, sick and sweet,

then beckons me toward her ashen breast,

infatuation I detest,

a seduction so strange-divine,

I’m losing strength to decline

her offer, that dark invitation;

curse this morbid fascination!

A smirk plays in her starless eyes,

as she prepares to claim her prize.

A trap this is, I’m almost certain,

yet I know not what’s past the curtain.

Come, and go; but to what end?

A choice I cannot comprehend.

Deceit I know this all could be,

and yet her power her over me 

has me sighing, aching, yearning, 

for that sweet release I’m burning.

A love affair that leaves me breathless;

I can’t resist, thou wicked temptress!

Come closer,

Come closer,

Come closer, 

Come—

213|taking flight|"
I watched my father kill a bird today. 

A baby fledgling with its adult feathers poking through. 

I caught it before we saw how it was

Curled in on itself, bent broken backwards. 



/


No choice in it. 

Best to kill it quick. 


/


I wondered what it would be like to watch something die, 

whether I should prove that I’m a man, 

step up to the plate, knock it out the park, shoot my shot. 

I nearly offered, swallowed my tongue. Felt a rush. 


/



My father voice was gruff. 

Take it out back he said. 

I don’t want anyone to see this. 

His hands shook as he loaded the gun. 



/



It didn’t die immediately. 

Again, again, again. 

It shook and quivered and 

its broken wings beat against the ground. 


/



I watched the first shot. 

I couldn’t watch the last. 


/


It was dead after the first he said.

 It was dead  after the first. 

I nodded, and he came back inside, miserable. 



/



It taught me something about me and him;

How it means to be a man. 

I’m not sure what yet, but 

all I can see is that broken baby bird 

and my fathers shaking hands.

214|Maybe One More Day|"
*TRIGGER WARNING: SUICIDAL THOUGHTS*  

#Maybe One More Day
*by L.F. Call*

*****

Maybe one more day, she said,  
And put the pistol down.  
Let's see if something changes.  
Or my luck gets turned around.  
Maybe I can muddle through  
To see just one more dawn.  
I think that I would like that  
Before I'm dead and gone.  

&nbsp;  

And night turned into day,  
And then the day turned into night.  
And then it came and went again,  
The dark displacing light.  
And three more times, and then a fourth  
As honest as the sun.  
Before she knew, a week slipped by.  
And then she saw the gun. 

&nbsp;  

Once again it called to her:  
A siren's aching wail.  
A screeching scree inside her mind  
Like glass and rusty nails.  
It trembled as she raised it  
To her lips and opened wide,  
For nothing in that week  
Had really changed, she realized. 

&nbsp;  

But all those sunsets, steeped in red,  
And pinks, and yellow hues,  
And crimson-purple violets  
That blended into blues...  
Maybe one more week, she thought.  
I'd like to see some more.  
Maybe there's a little left.  
And then I'll close the door. 

&nbsp;   

So seven nights, they cycled by,  
With seven more todays.  
And oh, you should have seen the skies  
That heaven sent her way.  
It was another month before  
She felt that tug again.  
That numbing itch, that restless fool,  
That everpresent friend. 

&nbsp;  

It called again, and this time  
It was stronger than the last.  
*""Ya’ nothin. Nobody would even  
Notice if ya’ passed.""*  
And, heaven help her, she believed it.  
Every single word.  
No matter how insipid.  
No matter how absurd. 

&nbsp;    

Every lie that pistol told  
She held them in her heart.  
Then placed the barrel 'gainst her chest  
To rip them all apart.  
She didn't know how long she stood  
There, frozen and resigned  
But when the sun came up, she knew  
It must've been some time. 

&nbsp;  

Through bleak and heavy lids,  
She saw the golden break of day.  
And something lifted deep inside.  
Something in the grey.  
Some weight unclenched. Some shadow fled.  
Some knot just came undone  
And scurried on dark wings  
Into some crevice of that gun. 

&nbsp;  

Maybe one more day, she said.  
Hell, maybe one more year.  
Or maybe two or three,  
Or maybe lifetimes in the clear.  
And maybe there'll happy days,  
And maybe there'll be sad.  
But maybe there's a life out there...   
***And maybe that's not so bad.***

216|Written on a lonely Sunday evening|"I watched a show where lovers kissed;

Pity I shall never do the same:

Girls will not listen to my lips,

Let alone meet them with theirs.

Okay.

Any more words like this,

And I’ll start sounding

Like an incel.

&#x200B;

I write these words on the notepad

Of my phone.

It’s always there for me,

Where I can bury my sorrow 

In meaningless things,

Then catch sight of your face

And feel sorry for myself

Again.

And again.

And again.

&#x200B;

How pathetic I have been:

Twice have I promised

To never write about you again

And twice now I have failed,

Taking to my poet’s honour 

With the sledgehammer,

The sledgehammer of worthless, gnawing,

Contemptible love.

&#x200B;

Did I honestly just say poet's honour?

Honour?

What honour is there in this act of mental ecstasy?

Where is the honour in drooling over your mere memory,

Like a stray bitch over decaying flesh.

Where is the honour in not being able to move on, like everyone else manages to do?

You, my muse, when did I last hear your word?

When you and I were but children,

Innocent.

And free.

And your voice has faded in my mind:

For even the broadest of deep, dismal caverns,

Cannot draw out an echo

Forever.

&#x200B;

This poem is a mess.

The words are not beautiful:

For this love is twisted,

A canker taking root

Where it cannot be drawn out.

How my heroes would sneer

At this angsty regurgitation,

The verbal diarrhoea

Of a worthless adolescent.

That doesn’t matter.

You won’t even read this, thank Christ.

I write for strangers.

&#x200B;

I can say no more.

Perhaps I can tell you about violent, bloody cuts to the wrist.

But that would be a lie, for I dare not.

Hell, I’m even an outcast among my fellow depressives.

At least they can bear the sight of blood.

&#x200B;

Goodbye, cruel world.

&#x200B;

No.

&#x200B;

I can’t do that either.

&#x200B;

What more can I say,

But goodnight

221|When Days Went Slowly By|"When we were young and fancy-free;    
When days went slowly by;    
When time was passed in reverie    
And asking “how?” and “why?”     

When all our worries, big and small,    
Would simply slip away;    
And all the time, do you recall,    
We set aside for play?    

How fast, it seems, the past can pass   
If not we’re well aware;   
And though I know it’s gone - alas -    
It feels like I’m still there.

222|A Poem I Wrote For You But Can't Work Up the Nerve to Show You|"It's not like I'm in love

It'd just be nice to have someone & feel alive

I've been down & out so much I didn't realize

I have feelings still they didn't die

It's not like I'm in love, in fact we barely speak,

That's fine... 

I can still remember how you'd look at me with golden eyes... 

I wonder if you've held that stare, there's been some time between then and now and you and I, 
We might have felt that sting when feelings are weaponized but I bet you still shine

Just like that sunbeam on the bus that I would try to warm myself beside 

And we would talk about the ways we'd wasted time

How I had spent my day lost & getting high

I wondered if it was that strange that you were 
always on my mind

I guess it can't be that bad cause I'm stuck like that again, tonight...

It's not like I'm in love, but having someone would be nice...

Always hated how I knew exactly what to say
Except to girls like you who took my breath away, so I put it on a page...

in the mornings - 

hair down, freckles askinder - 

when your fingers curled over mine

without trapping me there,

when you didn't ask me to stay

but I wanted to

&nbsp;

Before the world demanded us to be

who we were,

and we could be

anything - 

Before we opened our eyes

and recognized our anxieties

in each others' faces -

&nbsp;

In those moments,

with your breath promising nothing but another,

I think I must have told you I loved you

with the backs of my feet on your thigh

&nbsp;

I think I must have told you how beautiful you were

when you were sure no one was watching

224|I was born with flower buds sprouting from my skull|"I was born with flower buds sprouting from my skull,

Such silly pink things,

They were almost mistaken for little tufts of newborn hair.

I was a giggling mess,

My flowers running wild,

“What lovely flamingoes my darling has!”

Is what my mother told people, at least.

They would smile through glazed eyes,

But even my tiny mind could see glaciers behind pupils,

Grossly black voids drilled into their own heads.

As I aged,

I tended to a garden,

Doves’ nests resting quietly in the blooming bushes.

But people had come to smile less,

Their eyes leaking shadows—

I didn’t know that glares could kill a forest.

One day, a boy spewed nothings into my face,

But Nothing is a disturbing creature,

And it was verbicide mutated into herbicide—

I thought my flowers were beautiful, though!

I drove violently down the road,

Watching as petals littered my dashboard,

I tried saving what I could,

But my head might as well have been burned to ash.

The only survivor of my garden’s apocalypse was a measly peony,

Barely breathing with a smoker’s lung.

I ripped her from my skull,

And I have never felt such pain.

I locked her into a cage,

Because she wasn’t even pretty enough to press into a book.

And now, I was a member of the hallowed ones,

My once-earthy eyes were desolate,

Dying,

Probably dead.

I was finally cast into a deserving winter.

But even roses grow back after a sadly-sung tragedy,

For it is the nature of nature itself,

Yet I was naive enough to deny myself of light.

“It takes time,” I whispered to myself,

As I hesitantly unlocked my old friend’s cage,

She didn’t deserve such a punishment.

Seated atop my head again,

She smiled in the sun,

And I followed like a glowing mother,

But we are both still children,

Spring is just beginning, my dear.

226|The Things I Do To Feel Alive|"    I'm the friend that walks behind when the sidewalk won't fit three
    I'm the burnt out light house bulb that keeps the sailor out at sea
    The things I do to feel alive just end up hurting me
    And my mind's the only place in which only I can be

    Sometimes I'm scared of fear because I know it's in my head 
    And my head's a place of dissonance where lonely thoughts are fed
    The things I do to feel alive make me wish that I were dead
    I'm just a careless keeper of all the words I've never said

    But when the clock strikes three am and everyone's asleep
    I'll lie awake and dream about the boy I couldn't keep
    The things I do to feel alive just make me feel so cheap
    The sailor at sea is drowning now in waters fierce and deep

    I'm lonely and I'm bitter and I'm rotting at my core
    My eyes are windows to my soul because I locked the door
    The things I do to feel alive won't be done anymore
    I guess I'll just keep living, although I do not know what for

    Maybe if the sidewalk widened, or the sailor had more skill
    Or if I didn't need to take so many pills
    Or if my feet stopped dangling over this window sill 
    The things I do to feel alive will come in for the kill

my old man lives down here in texas;

something about pretending feels safe,

new york doesn’t need saving.   
but the boy from west texas with painted fingernails   
can’t grasp a hiding place, so he puts one in his pocket.

I attest I never asked for,

and I did not deserve.

Fortune bore me into love;

Opportunity ne’er lost me.

Cowardice accreted my strength;

Haunting mistrust with ev’ry intent.

I still need so much.

The light and the shadows

Forged me swift with power and purpose.

I am charged: give mercy.

You’re an average person

Here at an average theater

With an average friend

Listening to this average meter

&#x200B;

You’ve always loved music

But you never tell anyone

The one time you broke

They had a bit of fun

&#x200B;

Everyone knows you’re a shame

Everyone knows you’ve no fame

And as a matter of fact

You’re a talentless hack

No one will remember your name

&#x200B;

The violins began to play

As you lift your head up above

You see the musicians sway

Their faces filled with love

&#x200B;

Their love for music

The same as yours

Their love so apparent

In every chorus

&#x200B;

Their love sparks a fire inside 

And you look to your friend right beside 

You take his hand

‘Let’s start a band!’

He responds by smiling wide

&#x200B;

The crowd stretches out before you

As you hear their cheers

All these people adore you

And you start to feel the tears

&#x200B;

Your friend is across the stage

With a smile and a wink

You feel the music in your hands

And you start to blink

&#x200B;

You feel the love in you

And you can’t wait to begin

Like the musicians before you

You express the love within

And my hands helping the bad escape.

And you don't judge. And you don't speak.

And I see you look away, and I know.

You weren't expecting honesty.




So I lie, and I shrug it off.




But then you call me, 

And say that you're here for me.

And I trusted you.

And I was right to.




You ask me if I'm okay.

And I don't have to lie today.

Because I am. I'm okay.

Because you were there

They wash their cracked hands, their labored faces, their souls for imperfections, but

The dirt never leaves their lungs, their muddy breath forced to cough and croak songs without music.

Under that neon lamplight, mothers bring their children to the flies, like a baptism for the dead;

The children shove their faces into the gas station windows, or else watch the backs of their fathers

To stare at neon is to know the abyss behind it.

240|POLTERGEIST|" 

The armrest is mine, or should be—

Middle seat and all—

But still his sleeve violates me.

Absent any breeze it wanly kisses, then

Obscenely tongues my bare arm as if

Steered by a poltergeist, malicious, invisible.

We are fellow captives here

Seven miles above the Rockies

Securely stowed in a fastness of petroleum byproducts

But still he is my enemy.

 

I should have paid for first class;

I should have worn longer sleeves.

 

Dimly I sense the heat from his elbow,

A corona of pallid warmth

Nudging me with each intake of breath

Which he insists on executing

With great regularity and volume.

It has been five hundred and sixty-three days

Since the last heat of another’s touch

Faded from the small of my back

The blood long since having rushed back in

To fill the pale whorls and crescents

Left by teeth and hands, a fingerprint

Writ large on arms and back and chest

And I think about sexual frustration,

How once it was thought to animate the *geists*

That plied their antics on the frigid or hysterical,

Prying open the clenched Victorian fist of propriety

By hurling toys and dishes, knocking picture frames from the wall

With chilly fingers, seeking warmth that still lingered

On those items marked by love.

 

This playful ghost seeks not to trouble my sleep

But to pierce the spherical mask of one-way glass

That holds in the rare and fragile gasses

That are the only air I know, that allow me

To dive these deep and social seas. It knows

I long to taste other atmospheres,

With no pane between us

Fogged by my own stale breath.

For a moment I lean into the airspace

Of my seatmate, faint with the afterimage

Of good soap and aftershave: clean citrus, sandalwood.

He stirs in his sleep, his arm resting gently against mine

For a moment before he pulls away, smiling an apology.

He does not see my smile in return

Nor notice how I slow my breathing to match his,

As he settles back into the deep rhythm of inhale-exhale

That I have come to know so well in our time together.

244|A poem I wrote when I couldn't sleep.|"    The lights stop burning at the 29th hour. 
    The sheep are mocking me.
    I hear nothing but the ticking, 
    Ticking,
    Ticking
    Of the clock, 
    And the whispers of the day gone: 
    “Another one wasted” 
    “Did you really show your best?” 
    “Another day closer to --” 
    The anxieties knot into an alarm 
    I don’t know if they’re pulling me into them,
    Wrapped in the comfort 
    That if I didn’t worry, I wouldn’t care
    Or pushing me out of my mind 
    Because I’m not quite good enough there. 
    
    The lights start burning at the 39th hour. 
    Too bright, too bright to keep my eyes open, 
    But too enticing to let them close. 
    I want to find meaning in this.
    I want to find meaning in you. 
    Have I lost sleep because you lost me, 
    And you took that in trying to find me? 
    The conversations that we lost 
    Found their way back to me. 
    Is it because you’re saying them again? 
    Is it because they want to be heard? 
    They’ll have to fade to a whisper though,
    Mum, because sleep and I have catching up to do. 
    
    The mind starts wondering at the 49th hour. 
    But time’s just a word for now.
    This is the hour of the soul, 
    The flight into the wordless and thoughtless. 
    Automaton, I don’t see with my eyes. 
    I see stars at midday, shining, 
    Glistening, 
    Glazing the sky. 
    Some are probably dead. 
    I see the man the boy always wanted to become, 
    Standing back-turned to the man he became. 
    The terrible insight of the unbroken light,
    One day, maybe, I’ll see nothing.

When night held the earth neath a velvet black sea,

The meadow grass waved to the whim of the breeze;  
Those shooting stars fell to the will of black seas.  
But I and the moonlight, ’til nighttime had passed,  
Just sat there alone in that sweet meadow grass.

250|A Life Not to Waste|"  

I aspire to be trash; not trashed, garbage

Is what I long to be. At least then there’d be a

Use for me. I would wait in a bin, among a

Litter of my kin, until Tuesday came around.

Then a man would come with an empty frown

And toss me down to drown in the filling truck;

My existence would give him purpose. 

In the blackness I could breathe, under other

Jostling junk. There’d be no worries to ignore;

Inaction is the running norm for trash flung

To the back of a puke-green garbage truck.

&#x200B;

I probably don’t deserve it, but I’d like to be

Discarded scraps: A banana shriveled black or

A wing with bits of meat caught in the crack.

Then a junkyard dog, with fur to match its fortune

And ribs hugged by hollow skin, would sniff me

As fresh enough to munch. I hope to help the

Hungry hound scrounge some semblance of a snack,

And return unto the earth as decomposing crap.

&#x200B;

Although I want for death, 'tis as wishing to be rich

And buying a lottery ticket. If I brought about my end

I’d always be a bigot, for spilling all the sand 

I could spend restoring balance. Rather I’ll suffer on,

And pen poetry instead: so someone else might 

Realize that they’d rather be rubbish than dead.

The poem is a little strange and I am unsure what to think of it myself, but its growing on me. Thanks in advance and I hope you enjoy!"

In rainbows hiding pots of gold 

And legends that have been retold. 


I believe in falling stars

In outer space, and life on Mars

In tossing coins in wishing wells

And ocean waves inside sea shells.


I believe that demons flow 

Through gossip whispered soft and low 

In nightmares holding unvoiced fears

That roses grow from angels tears.


I believe we live again

Death a new time to begin

That each and every earthly loss

Determines how our stars will cross.


I believe each tear you cry

Becomes a star that maps the sky 

That will lead me, born anew

Somehow, somewhere, someday, to you.

264|I Became A Man|"I didn't become a man

when I won my first fight

I became a man

The first time I lost

I learned nothing from victory

But failure taught me the cost

&nbsp;

I did not become a man

From my fathers emotional abuse

To this day

The man has his excuse

He'll tell you he toughened me up

He never did

Do not mistake for masculinity

The hatred and violence that I hid

I was not a man all the times I fantasized

About punching him in the teeth

I became a man when I forgave him

He could only win

If I became  him underneath

&nbsp;

No manliness did I find

In all those days I spent alone

Isolated and brooding

inside of my own home

convinced no one could help me

because i'd never let them try to set me free

I became a man when I looked around

and saw my family

Little cousins might annoy a boy

but a man is wise enough to know

To love the noisy chaos

and only kindness show

&nbsp;

I did not become wise

With some intellectual master key

Instead I became a student of life

So much to learn and see

I'm better now than I was last year

Ten years from now i'll be better still

And when i'm eighty I'll laugh at the young fools

Calling me over the hill

Kindness and ambition and humility

I pray these be my trademarks

Be wary of anyone who tells you

That men must have dark hearts

Don’t create chaos where you go, leave a paved road for your sons to follow

  


This world should not be left as you found it, make it better

  


Leave a legacy of greatness, not one of ill will and destruction

  


Our bodies fade, our memories fade, but the changes we make to this world are permanent

  


Don’t let a line of broken relationships or a list of petty deeds be the last memories of you

  


Go out an even greater person than you came in, with an even brighter spirit

  


When you leave this world go to your resting place with a smile

  


A smile so deep that no amount of decay can remove it from your face

  


Don’t just be what they expect you to be, be what you know you should

  


Go out not as just a boy but as a man

  


I am peace, therefore I am at peace… be at peace.

267|No, like, where are you really from?|"Quiet.

My skin tells its stories

in the breath between words

you'll get no answers

if you keep asking questions

&#x200B;

Pressing.

Probing will do you no better

it is sun-worn seashell

worm-signed without letters

cracks and stabs at your touch

&#x200B;

Stop.

How easy to rest easy

when you write the script

when you carve your own throne

How smooth you slip into identity

&#x200B;

Listen.

From up there you cannot see

how your doubt becomes a scalpel

cuts blood from mind and muscle

with sideshow curiosity

&#x200B;

Know.

I am more than roots and pedigree

I am motion and memory

I am poetry

I am here.

268|Hevel Beach|"**Hevel Beach or Galveston**

She walks the outline of the sea,  
circle skirt rippling in mimicry,

its frenetic shadow glossing over   
belts of seashells planted gravestone-firm.

Over there, the beautiful women kneel   
pendulum-breasted in pastel one-pieces

as they pull their babies   
from the lapping folds.

Poor creatures, they want their gills!  
Of course, the mothers fail

for the sea, like an aging woman,  
collects everything for itself.

Just how many shutters and shingles,   
and soggy castles,

polyester ribbons or flakes of skin   
has it pulled from this shore alone

to disintegrate under foamy sheets?  
You are nobody in these waters—

less real than Icarus,  
less real than a brief exhale from a mermaid’s gill,

for the sea makes all men bastards  
and every child an orphan.

With eyes closed and lashes matted,  
the young girls lie flat on their backs, telling stories

as elastic skin dries in drooping sun.  
She hesitates to take her place among them

and faces the insouciant waves   
that bulge and flop at peak iridescence,

obscuring every reflection,  
turning all conversation into smoky babble.

269|"""Her, The Dancer"""|"  

""5, 6, 7""  
she led me  
 my body then whirling, bending   
 the remembrances of   
 a warmth from her pointed hand,  
 life   
 a crooked pirouette

eyes closed  
 off balance and falling toward   
 the thunderous open sea   
 

was it me?   
 me?  
was it at horizon's edge?  
or the lack of gravity?   
 

I prepared for days of grey  
 a life tossed 

 a plunge into that maritime enigma  
 a hell made not of brimstone but of  
 

memories  
 

but when my eyes were pried open  
 she revealed herself to be not a sea  
 but a world of color  
 

 her brilliantly diaphanous marble   
 an Earth where thunders dare not to stir me from my slumber  
 where the bellows of the heavens  
 instead lulled me to sleep

on the table; 
-
you silently stroking the ink on my inner thigh, and making my heart strings quiver

the soft, subtle breeze of your breath

273|Insomnia|"If to sleep is for the weak,  

I must be stronger than them all.  

But to sleep would be a dream,  

in which I pray to fall. 

A twist of sheets and deafening creeks,  

a suffocating shawl.  

To drown in air is true despair,  

the body my mind’s thrall. 

A thinning patience and ticking time,  

thoughts a drunken squall.  

A brittle silence piercing shrieks,  

yet never spoke at all.

275|Speak To Me, Manager|"This is a job interview. I'm  
going to ask you some very personal questions.  
Who are you. Where  
is home for you and why  
haven’t you been back.  
Who is your father and why does  
he not answer. What do you seek  
in this madness of a sea.  
Would you like a coffee or tea.  
Can you roll a boulder up a hill for eternity.  
What are your salary expectations  
and why do you expect to be  
worth anything at all.  
Do you think if your catalogued  
regrets were compressed into a fatberg  
of hate and loss it would constipate  
you until death.  
I'll give you some time  
to answer these. Would you like  
another coffee or tea. I see  
your references are your mom and your  
cat and you mention please don't   
call your cat during business  
hours because he has meetings  
with his parole officer. Please call  
the police. We have been trapped   
in this open plan office for the length of Lent.  
Sometimes we all pound on the glass  
hoping the passerby will hear  
our metallic shrieks. Some  
of us have become cybonic  
half-human half-exposed brick  
half-upholstered half-titan  
cyclopses, blinded by fluorescent tubes, but  
at least there are no cubicles. Charbydis  
snarls below on the street for yet another  
bus to be caught in the roaring  
and dragged to where  
the sun has been drowned and  
the dead walk free. The pros and cons  
of working in the industry I'd say  
are flexible hours and really great perks,  
especially the bike share program,  
we also give out free Macbook Airs,  
I'd say the bespoke salads are delicious  
but every time we reach for them they flee our   
grasp; cons are probably the furies    
screeching from the ceiling fan, the dog,  
ravenous, pawing the door,  
the nailbent chairs where the damned  
have been strapped and cry  
for mercy or for a second death.  
What do you want to do  
before you die. What is your   
ten year plan. What is your   
plan right now. Why   
is your muse silent.

277|THE THINGS I’M NOT|"&nbsp;

I lie awake at night makings lists of things I cannot be…

&nbsp;
  
I am not a dancer.  
But my heart?  
My heart doesn’t know that…  
It makes my feet tap each time they feel the rhythm of a song.  
It doesn’t know there’s need for longer feet and stronger arms.  
It doesn’t feel the extra weight, it doesn’t care the muscles hurt.  
My heart can’t rest until it matches every single note,  
Because all it knows is that my feet were meant to dance.  

&nbsp;
  
I am not a painter.  
But my eyes?  
My eyes don’t know that…  
They think you catch beauty in your brush just by looking.  
They don’t know you paint with the heart, not with the hands.  
They don’t care you must feel much more and think much less.  
My eyes can’t hide their lust for all the beauty in the world,  
Because all they know is that my hands were meant to paint.  

&nbsp;
  
I am not a writer.  
But my mind?  
My mind doesn’t know that…  
It makes my fingertips storm the keyboard at every thought.  
It doesn’t care of rhyme or structure, of classic tales and modern verse.  
It doesn’t see my words are much too empty and my stories way too thin.  
My mind can’t stop making up lines others have written before,  
Because all it knows is that my fingers were meant to write.  

&nbsp;
  
I lie awake at night making lists of things I haven’t been,  
Counting every failure I had and all the trophies that I’ve missed,  
Marking each step I never took and every place I’ve never been,  
Gathering people I’ll never be and all the things I’ll never do.  
But my dreams?  
My dreams don’t know all that…  
Because I close my eyes and in my dreams I am a dancer and a painter and a poet.

278|the colour of you|"flesh, a dot of lemon

for the form of your arms

bleeding off the tip of my brush

a bed I never knew

my mother reminding me 

to not make homes out of people 

anymore 

/

parchment 

for the sentimental things 

stippled and stained across it all 

like love notes and the salt of your skin 

or the whites of your eyes 

when they were looking

for mine

/


terre verte, traced with pearl

for the gardens that grew

my spine, ribs, and bones, a trellis

wet with dew on my lip and wherever

you would have had it

coming into season, yours

to reap


/

burnt sienna

for the ache that welled

because the ring in my ears was not 

the rush of my blood or my lungs deflating

but your voice suggesting 

to just let it hurt until 

it doesn't

/

payne's gray

for the newfound silence

the walls exhale and the floorboards creak

our lives parallel, giving up

until sleep takes over; a dream

of your hand in mine 

again

/

mars black

for the hunger in the pit of my chest

the things we find when we are not even looking

standing still at the end of a story

the only gift on offer

her happiness

over mine

nor must you post a copy to a partner,

please hold these thoughts until they can be spoken,

While our worlds are such that I should not reply,

And I fair putzed around until

These puffy envelopes of stars

Became these happy blobs at will.

All matter dark, all forces stretched;

How drawn we are together now,

On each our blackened surface etched.

How hard to capture you in slides—

Bright chaos with its winged effects;

Infalling satellites and tides,

Those distant clouds your dust reflects.

No center does my Hubble seek;

But scours the black for scuffs of hope,

While asteroids do spark and streak.

I dream of you asleep all day.

285|Abuse|"
I'm abusive 

I don't scream, I don't shout

Yet, I'm abusive

I've never laid a finger on her

And, I'm abusive 

Because she is my recovery program 

I used her, like the needle 

I used her, to lift myself up

She reached for my heart but couldn't find it

Because I lacked one in the first place

I never beat her into submission 

I never made her afraid 

My sin is greater than that 

I made her comfortable, and warm

I made her feel loved when I was empty inside 

I'm abusive 

Because I drain her when she does not know it 

I'm abusive

Because in the end I can't commit

And it hurts her when I show that I care 

But she sees right through me

Beyond my shell, into my abyss 

I'm abusive 

Because I have no heart to give 

Even when I say I do

    a boy drove by me and called me that.  
    But my shorts were rolled up tonight,

    My eyes were tearing -- the light, laying over my hometown  
    like a bison tired in the tall grass at day’s end, and  
    Gay Angels playing on the teeth of a steel comb in my headphones.  
    He was muscular in his white truck laying rubber.  
    His eyes, full of love for his friend riding shotgun, were wild.  
    My high school lust lost his opium partner to a commuter rail,  
    the fury of a god unleashed on the body of a child.
    Tonight, I didn't want to scream back at him as he rolled on,

Now that it has been about a day, I can reveal the purpose of this poem. A poem by u/spitwitandwater inspired me to think about how poetry is received here. I had a hypothesis that poems that are cliched or 'artistically' but unjustifiably vague often do better than well crafted poetry. I know in my experience that poems which I tried to be very honest, or in ones that I spent longer amounts of time on, were not received particularly well in terms of upvotes or volume of comments. So to test this, I wrote this poem in a couple of minutes and posted it. The poem is not good. It is inconsistent, transparent and pointlessly abstract. However, it also got 26 upvotes in less than 24hrs and is by far my most successful poem on reddit. I am not saying I am clever or that my other poems are masterpieces. I simply wanted to point out that there is a trend here to praise certain kinds of poems that don't always deserve it, while other absolute gems that I have read have been ignored. 
Thankyou all for your replies, and thanks u/spitwitandwater for inspiring me to begin this little test."

clearly than ever and it burnt a hole through me.   
i saw how it formed in your chest, a small green bulb that   
grew with the help of those who’ve watered it like sadistic gardeners
with bloody rubber gloves and high fructose syrup sweat.  
   
   
your nails sparkled like the glitter underneath your   
eyes illuminated by the five a.m. moon.   
the pale glow of the stars outlined someone created by   
the ghost of michaelangelo up in the yellow clouds    
of heaven.   
  
  

i could swear the scars were visible on your irises.  
i was struck with the jarring realization that no one saw through the    
contacts hanging loosely from your cornea or     
through your thick clear glasses that i always loved so much.    
  
  

we took the long way home at five am because the gate was locked  
and i would’ve booked plane tickets to los angeles   
right then and there if i could.  
  
   

i would’ve held you the whole plane ride,   
my hands through your newly blonde hair and my   
lips leaving a trail down your cheekbone    
and i’d tell you that our lives were just beginning because    
they really are but they take it from you     
like you’re job and we’re living in   
a twisted, godless version of the old testament.   

you collapsed into me like a marble sculpture from the top of   
a beautifully decorated italian restaurant down in rome.  
i could feel the tears on my shoulders being mopped up  
by a loosely fitting nintendo 64 pacsun shirt and i held you   
closer to me than bone marrow.   
   

   
i prayed to the newly-awake sesame seed colored birds  
and asked them to make my love a tsunami that could  
envelop you entirely and transfer the pain to me.  
the molecules could serve as noble martyrs.   
   
    
i wonder when you’ll see the love and attraction   
you bring to the table.  
the way your timid laugh booms through the air,  
forcing the electrons in the deep oak to shake,   
electrocuting all who dare stand too close.  
  
  

i drove away and cried to myself    
because i’ve never had a love in which i felt     
another person’s pain.   
that’s how i know it’s real but in that   
car i swore to every living being on this   
planet that i’d protect you because   
when i see you i see my future    
and i know because i always thought my   
future was the brightest part of me

Her god is the god of broken things  
Of secret words caressed by tongues,  
Of wounds and scars and burnt-out stars  
That never became suns.  
That never quite were suns.  
&nbsp;  
She worships the god of broken things  
Who busts the bells on handlebars  
Who bends the rims and sings a hymn  
With jarring off-key choirs.  
With jarring angel-choirs.  
&nbsp;  
She prays to the god of broken things  
That all that's fragmented in him  
Might come undone, and thus become  
A better man within.  
A better man’s within.  
&nbsp;  
Her god is the god of broken things–  
Of battle-scars and aching,  
Of things undone which might become  
Stronger for the breaking.  
She's stronger for the breaking.

308|I Am Not a Prisoner in My Own Mind|"I am not a prisoner in my own mind.

I am locked out, blocked in, trapped

In the Hoarding witnessing myself

Desperately defending the walls

And frantically assailing them

Beating off the heartless hordes

Of barbarians trying to pillage my mind

And ramming the gates with my fists

And my feet in futile attempts to gain entry

To my own heart and the feelings within

That break my body when my will is strong

And I watch myself collapse and am disgusted

As my insides become my outsides and

My knees bend to kneel to a lord I cannot see

How they do not obey me

But surely they must and I do not know myself

And how can I when I am denied a voice

Even within my head and I cannot hear

The voices that move me are against me

But what am I to do for I am not held in a jail

Or atop a tower on wheels upon which I can scale

The walls that deny me and will not move

&#x200B;

I am not a prisoner in my own mind.

I am locked out, blocked in, trapped

In the Hoarding arguing

With a mindless voiceless inside

And a mindless voiceless outside

As if I am a mindless voiceless inbetween

309|Not Like Her|"she's something, isn't she?

a something made of somethings

tresses trickles of whiskey

spilling from bottles into thirsty throats;

eyes overflowing cups

too kind not to catch 

the scattering strobe lights,

scintillating, watching,

her line-of-sight her dance partner

to the beat pounding under her wrist. 

she's the girl of my dreams;

if telephone directories are places,

she doesn't exist there;

she exists,

if only on highways

snaking through the movies

reeling in my head,

but she exists,

dancing away her summer nights 

in dusty clubs

till blackbirds break dawn and

spill its yolk

all over mildewed parking lots. 

she's the girl

with the corner store chic

making smoke and sweat 

seem like 

stripped-down human sentiments;

a lover at the nape

with no name

could spell frivolous

on anyone's forehead

but hers;

she's actual. 



i'm not fooled by her actualness

on sane days;

she's a museum exhibit

to gawk at, to dream of,

not to touch, 

not to plagiarize. 

but then come the days

i've consumed the sight of walls 

while lending my forearm

love bites with no love,

as every second scurries 

away from the next,

sick of the latter's staleness 

till the day 

runs out of seconds

to force stale.



on these days, she rings truer than actuality.


she's something, isn't she? 

the girl of my dreams;

she's a lot like me

but

i'm not enough like her.

310|Everybody Talks About the Weather|"Do you ever

Wake up and it's bright outside

Picturesque spring late morning and

You think, good for some but not for me

I think I'll just stay in today

&nbsp;

Do you ever

Think that when it's hot outside it's too hot to go outside and

When it's cold it's too cold to go outside

And when it's somewhere in the middle it's just insipid and you need something to inspire some thing inside you

&nbsp;

Do you ever

Feel like the wind lashes your skin and

The light burns your eyes

Did she used to call you a vampire for blacking out your bedroom windows

But she didn't know the half of it

&nbsp;

Are your

Best friends cats but you even get annoyed at them sometimes

&nbsp;

Do you ever

Get a message from a real human, a former lover, former friend

And you read it as soon as it arrives

Because your phone is always in your hand

And you come up with the perfect reply

But you don't send it straight away because that would be weird

It would be really obvious that you're dead

&nbsp;

So you decide to reply tomorrow, but the longer you don't reply for the more anxious you get about replying

Or more like

There's a sudden increase in anxiety after you don't reply for a day and then it stays along a long plateau of intensity

Until you realise it doesn't matter

Some months later

&nbsp;

Do you ever wish you'd just shut up

&nbsp;

Do you ever

Have this internal struggle over

Whether to trust what people say about you or not

Like it feels great to be respected

But you know they're just lying

And you have to balance how you see it

&nbsp;

Do you ever

Think about all of the things you'll never amount to

But entertaining the idea of them is alluring enough to

Make sure your prophecies come true

&nbsp;

Do you ever think

About just getting up

Walking straight out of the house

And not stopping walking and

Just seeing what happens

&nbsp;

Do you ever think

There are things which bring you joy but

They're not the kind of things you can hold on to

They're totally ephemeral

And tuning yourself in to those stations is labour enough to dissuade you from trying

&nbsp;

And when did you realise

That when they drag you off to hospital

They don't actually cure you, they just stop you from dying

&nbsp;

And it gets to the point where

The doctor is asking *you* what *you* want and it's like

**YOU'RE THE FUCKING DOCTOR**

&nbsp;

Do you ever

Think it's a modern disease

It's not your fault

Not your mum's failing

Top 100 depression memes 2018

Stop staring at your screens

Says the man

Staring at us through our screens

Whose entire business is built around digital platforms

&nbsp;

Do you ever hear

People say my family come from Gaza, but everyone here is much more miserable

Like you need something to die for to have something to live for

You need something to suffer for to have something to get pleasure from

You need something to struggle for to have something to grease your wheels but that struggle can't be struggle itself

&nbsp;

How many of your friends and acquaintances

Have half a million clauses to their professed identities

And their epistemology does include the word community

But only in the sense of short messages exchanged between people who have never met each other

&nbsp;

Have you ever thought

Something needs to be done about this

But I'm too hungry right now

And bought a kebab off Deliveroo

And when the delivery man knocks on your door

With your food in one hand and his phone pressed to his ear in the other

And he's arguing with his girlfriend

And you're wearing pyjamas at 6 o'clock in the evening

And you realise

He's not actually a delivery man at all

He's just a man

Like an actual real human

Just like you

313|Break the Skin|" 

And I can smile sometimes if I try really hard

But it feels disingenuous so tell me what's the point

Of all this suffering 

When every day seems a little bit worse than the last one

And you start wondering 

How many shitty days does it take

How many shitty days

Turn into shitty weeks

Turn into shitty years 

That make up a shitty life 

That just doesn't seem worth living anymore

And you want to ignore 

That omnipresent existential dread 

That always creeps up on you when you let your guard down 

And crawls into the back of your head through your ears

And you fear

That one day you'll find yourself emotionally and mentally dead 

But still living 

A philosophical zombie

That can't see 

That this life has lost all meaning and value that you had once thought was intrinsic

But now you're starting to think it isn't

And you're starting to think 

All the lofty ideals you once clung to 

Were all just fabrications of an overactive imagination 

And you want to lash out 

But you've been self taught from childhood to keep your emotions to yourself

So you just grit your teeth a little bit harder 

And clench your fists so tight that the nails break the skin

    to work, the subway station, dropping  

    my phone, tumbling  

    onto the tracks. The tossing seizure  

    of the rail and the spray  

    of light power-washing  

    me awake just before.  


    Then your massive hand gently rubbing  

    my head, playing with my ears. I was  

    a good boy. I have to tell

    life is fading from my mind like  

    a tapestry with a thousand tiny  

    threads being tugged on all  

    at once, the holes are getting—

    lost in them.

    I’m writing. What was that?  

    a car. I need to tell you.

317|The Shaman|"Brittle bones on sinew string, 

Slice of beak, and plume, and wing, 

Scraps of fur with ebon beads,

Twisted bark from septic seeds,

Crystal charms and stones that float,

Rest upon the Shaman's throat.  

&#x200B;

A chilling hum which glows bright red, 

Spells out letters never read

And sings, in voices seldom heard, 

To speak in tongues without a word 

Ensnared or caught, with all perceived 

The Shaman sits, beneath the trees.

&#x200B;

Which whisper loud with leaves that peel 

And splinter open to reveal 

A face, that frowns with mirthless glee, 

In asymmetric symmetry. 

It screams to tear the jagged sky, 

The Shaman never wonders why.  

&#x200B;

Visions swim across the ground, 

Shouting bold in silent sounds 

Which echo through the empty space, 

And standing still you start to chase 

Those calls which split this senseless scene, 

The Shaman watches the unseen.  

&#x200B;

All at once you do regain 

Your thoughts, Yourself, as you restrain 

From thinking back on what just passed, 

But still you turn to try and ask 

The Shaman, who could make things clear, 

Already

He had

Disappeared.

Carefully

Awkwardly

I drop hints, thoughtfully

Grasping at broccoli

Partly

I’m partisan

Throw me a party

Pick out the best parts of me

Order me Chinese

Take-out

Pick-up

Leave a portion of my fortune

For the stake-out pickup 

Ask a badge for respect

And watch him go nuts

Something in the jelly doughnuts

Let’s chop suey 

Before I get sued

For a second time

Let’s shoot a movie

They have a hard time proving

All my shaking and my moving

At the moment 

Watching football

But look how angry 

They can get

With one missed field goal

Punch lines plucked up

Put down awkwardly with chopsticks 

I’m pulling punches 

Pulling strings of Russian rockets

319|MY FATHER|"My father is a land mass.

He is the North Star, 

An immovable object.

&#x200B;

His hands envelop mine; boulders, 

Swinging pendulously 

from shoulders 

Where I sit.

He is a force of nature, 

a smile from ear to ear.

His face creases with laughter 

and a lump forms in my throat.

Love, unspoken, walks in his giant footsteps.

My father can create things.

He can bend and break things, 

To his will.

&#x200B;

His knowledge eclipses me.

Understanding, compassion 

given freely when I ache.

He has the heart of ten men, 

courage in the face of fear.

His words fall like great drops of rain in a drought.

&#x200B;

My father is ill now.

He is small and sad, 

a burst thought.

His eyes shine blue,

Mine, a perfect rendering of his own.

We sit together in silence, 

enjoying the moment.

His father before him, 

reflected in us both.

Now it seems I am the land mass.

And he is an island.

320|Come lie with me|"

Come lie at my side in the dark.

In the fresh, soft grass of springtime.

Inhale deep the sweet, decaying scents.

A warm breeze blows and my mind drifts away.


I'm taken back to a place without a care.

You're sleeping in my arms while I whisper dreams of our future in your ear.

Waves crash onto the shore and a candle in the window flickers.

My mind snaps back and I feel the cold shock of reality.


And now I lie alone.

323|Me First|"*Disclaimer: I'm drunk. I wrote this in haste because I had the idea in my head. In many ways, it's awful poetry, but I'm keen on the idea/theme and would like to expound upon it. At some point I think I can turn this piece into something much more complex in terms of vocabulary, rhyme scheme, and complexity. Anyways, here's what I've got so far:*

My knees quivered

The air was thin

I wanted to jump

Then I saw your grin


You climbed the ladder

To the top of the dive

""Me first!"" you yelled

As you pushed me aside



I lost my balance

And fell off too

I was twelve years old

When I loved you



My finger trembled

The lights were dim

I said yes

On a hope and a whim



You were down on one knee

I asked for a kiss

""Me first!"" you exclaimed

And so began our bliss



I looked at our future

Sparkly and new

I was twenty years old

When I loved you



My stomach sank

The room was cold

I couldn't die

We're supposed to grow old



You stayed strong

And said I couldn't go

""Me first!"" you whispered

As if you could know



It was only cancer

We've got so much to do

I was thirty years old

When I loved you




My body numbed

Everything was silent

Delights and ends

Everything violent



You left a note

Right by the bed

""Me first"" you wrote

As you planned in your head



You ended your life

Before chemo round two

I was thirty one years old

When I lost you



*Tear it to shreds.*

324|The Song of the Spanish Guitar|"The gypsy man plays on warm summer days  
And on nights neath a lonesome bright star.  
He plucks a soft tune as he howls at the moon  
With the song of his Spanish Guitar.  

There’s a bump on a part of this gypsy man’s cart  
And it thumps with each turn of the wheel.  
It keeps him in time with his plucking and rhyme  
As he rides it from Rome to Castile.  

The people all flock as the gypsy cart rocks  
And approaches the town from afar,  
And they dance to his song as he rolls right along  
To the beat of his Spanish Guitar.  

The rich folks will waltz to cheap German schmaltz  
And operas are all of the rage,  
But the song from the cart has ten times more heart  
Than the music of balls or the stage.  

So I rosin my bow and I join in the show  
And I sing to the moon and the stars,  
But no fiddle can play in the rapturous way  
Of that gypsy’s sweet Spanish Guitar.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

ocean water fills my vessels
saturating my existence
with these tides
that i have no room for

it pushes me out of that place
i have presided too long
enveloping my withered body
with promises of apathy —

finally.

my blood dilutes — it dwindles
losing its grip on me
it lurches and grasps for my throat
and i cannot breathe

i do not want to drown in
everything i am
yet i do not want to become —
what i am not

i open my mouth to breathe
and draw brine deeply
into my lungs —
i am not welcome there

these limbs refuse to listen 
when i try to keep composed
even my own heart
begins to flow back on itself

i am helpless.
sometimes — there is nothing
you can do at all
except drift — endlessly

so i lay in my broken reverie
content with overflowing
cascades sweep me off my feet 
carrying me —

somewhere else entirely.

329|Sping is waiting for you|"Spring is calling beyond the rim,

She’s singing in Greek

And the double bass is walking,

with you, on one leg -

She comes, beltane dressed

And booming daffodils.

Both legs shimmering in bells,

The brass kicks, accordion lilts,

Not just the drummer smiles,

As the children stomp in unison.

Spring is opening her womb,

Engulfing the South Downs.

For all to revel in her fertility,

For all to open their petals,

To be cherished by the sun.

330|Lobotomy|"Have you ever tried to dig into your mind?

To sift and root through the clutter accrued,

To cut and burn all which you have derived,

To wade through the shit to save those precious jewels.




‘Tis an arduous task not many can bear

To look themselves deeper through their own eye.

To tread through the reflection, one should beware:

For you are the doctor with the best tools to pry.




They say it changes one, reforms them anew,

An archaic practice with a purpose most just

To probe the mind's eye and realign the sinew,

Until there’s nothing left but the reflection of a husk.




But was the atrocity worth it to quiet the demand?

A catharsis in killing, but your soul be damned.

I want to see your good side

Sharp jaw and cheek, poised marble, sliced and carved,

Delicate lines etched across a minted coin. 

Let me see your figure,

Broad, long, narrow, slender, 

But it’s best for carrying sails

Of cloth loosely draped and concealing.

&#x200B;

I like to see your good side,

So brush your hair forward, 

Wear that blank smile

Empty your eyes

Of all blood-black nothingness,

Turbulent oceans of raging insecurity 

Trembling and shaking your little prow.

Let me see your playful teasing,

Turn your fickle warmth into eternal worship.

&#x200B;

Throw out every one of your heart’s seasons, 

Save summer, and maybe spring if you’re lucky

But say farewell to mournful autumn and empty winter.

Lock them away out of sight

Keep them for 2am introspections 

Lonely cubicle ruminations

Stand naked then 

Stand on that island alone

I only like your good side

2. I am sorry

C, when ‘private numbers’

brought us together I did not know that

I would fall in love with the image of

what we could have been

but we were only thirteen, we were not

strong enough to carry an emotion much

older than us- It fucked us both up

even now, seeing you makes my knees week

I’d do anything to go back to twenty twelve

I think every once in awhile, I still wonder

&#x200B;

when I stumbled upon you, W

everyone saw it coming except for you and I,

you knew the truth but loved me anyways,

I gave you all of my firsts and you tried to

teach me about love but how can I love

you when I didn’t love myself

I was never content but it was

not your fault, you deserved

much more than my half heart

I’ll never stop being sorry

&#x200B;

I know from the start, R, we were

just a pitstop along the way, a shoulder

to cry on and an ear to listen

I’m not really sure if I loved you but

I can still remember what

hope and redemption tasted like

but we never loved each other at the

same time, the push and pull became

tiring and alcohol was easier to consume

I do not know a goodbye more beautiful

&#x200B;

I dropped everything for us, H, because

I believed we were soulmates and your

mother started calling me ‘daughter’, so

I finally let you in and you started breaking

promises, the resentment turned me numb

but you were the happiest I’ve ever been

our future together was just not worth

the struggle of pretending that we could read

each other's minds but don’t worry

we’ll reunite every moonlight at 11:11pm

&#x200B;

F, you picked me out of the best and took

me home, and I wanted to give you everything

but you were trying to build a kingdom from

ruins, of course it was bound to collapse

you made me feel so whole and I think

happiness is a beautiful look on the both of us

I’ve never let anyone in so easily but now

I understand why I hadn’t and I really should have

met you first because then maybe you can be

the *only man I’ve ever loved*

I say your name but it no longer rings true. 

Who are you dear child, What is your real name.

Are you happy with your self proclaimed fame?

Yes people know me that much is true

But the me they see, is actually you

They see a goof, a charmer, a clown you see

But that me is you, it’s really not me

Great grades, good friends all while lazing 

You must think you’re really quite amazing

But at the end of the day who cares if you're right 

You’re still alone, each and every night.

A night of writing seeking to find yourself

When you look in the mirror you see someone else

A person superficial judging a lot

But who am I to say that, I am what you’re not

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Ahh that’s right I’m I, and you, you 

We share a lot that much is true

We share nothing that’s also quite right

The me of day and the me of night

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

You exist at day when people play

The me that keeps sadness away 

You’re entertaining, funny to a fault

But what’s the point when you’re all you've got

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Then at night when it’s just you and you

The true me comes out of his cocoon

The Hyde of your Jekyll that’s me you see

The one who really knows how you can be

&#x200B;

 

Who are you child what is your purpose

Bringing sadness despair, keeping me hopeless

The side of me that no one knows 

Who communicates solely by written prose 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Hide him deep that’s what society says

Males are hard, no time for tears

But push me down as much as you like

For I am you and I’ll torture you at night

spotting their green suits  
with the brown of decay but  
again they returned to goad me on.

salting the earth with my anger  
gutting my enemy root and stem  
tearing out their yellow teeth and white hair but  
still my hated foe remained in place.

In my final year of war,

The storm clouds  
In the eyes  
That stared  
Back  
At me.  
  
The lonely soul  
I heard  
Beneath the happy voice,  
Talking with friends,  
Rambling on about  
Exotic birds and  
Heartbreak,  
And the past  
  
I heard you  
Searching for company  
Asking me if I wanted to  
Sit and just  
Talk  
Without our friends  
Just the two of us.  
  
You were  
The loneliness  
That reached for me  
And tugged on my sleeve  
Because you were alone  
And it was dark  
And you wanted me  
To be the waypoint.  
The strength  
That pushed on  
While you fell in  
Behind my confidence.  
  
You were

You were  
The abyss

With just  
Anyone.

Tore down  
All the beauty in your life  
And ate away at what was  
And still  
Couldn’t stomach

And still see me.  
  
Or if you try to sleep  
But you still hear my voice in the silence.

I only wrote this poem just for therapeutic reasons. I never intended it to be a masterpiece or anything as I didn’t even try to come up with a rhyme scheme or anything too clever, so this is completely free form. However, I still feel like sharing it and seeing how people interpret the expression I tried to convey in the stuff I write. I realize it’s not my best but it’s still nice to get the feelings out and still get to share it with someone."
343|trauma never knocks before it comes in|"Drunk on a Monday?

I feel the sneer

the inevitable curl of the lip and the staccato laugh

that burns like the vodka in my sprite bottle.

Exchanged glances, rolled eyes,

and I laugh too,

but it pitches and rolls,

stumbles under the weight of heedless insincerity.

&nbsp;

drunk on a Monday

and I can't be bothered to explain myself to the silence.

To the scratching of pencils on paper

and the tapping of fingers on keys,

I harmonize my sips to the melody

while a symphony of sympathy fills my ears.

and there's two ways out of here

one looks like a bottle and forgetting

the other is a razorblade and its kiss - 

I've tottered my way down both avenues before

but I'm getting tired of the scars - 

&nbsp;

drunk?

on a monday?

I lie in a bed next to my best friend

and in the darkness

I open my mouth,

pour out the secrets I can't stomach when I'm sober;

&nbsp;

but I'm drunk,

and it's Monday,

so he asks ""can we talk about this tomorrow""

and we both know

he's asking for us to never talk about this again.

I swallow the truth

and it turns my stomach

worse than any liquor ever has.

I wish that a finger in my throat could expel it just as quickly.

344|The Best Poem I've Ever Written|"    Write more please, but say less too; there's
    more to say, but not from you. Press
    that ballpoint 'til it bleeds for-

    Words are drugs- a filthy vice. Your
    livelihood pays dealer's price. In-

    high produced by mindless rage.

    Hollow rhymes you write for sport in
    empty lines for school report. Fa-

Strung out on a quick fix.

These ideals keep us lifted,

In a smoke cloud, persistent.

Fucking with the same shit;

Drugs are made to be did, kid.

And yes, I know how that sounds,

Ignorant and belligerent.

I keep it real, hedonistic,

Shameless, and overself-indulgent.


&nbsp;


The colors are all so vivid,

And the dialogue is scripted.

These life roles, we just fill in,

With some broken down commitments.

Mindset atavistic, 

And a new bag of mixed tricks

That will get me to where 

My next destination lives.

Perched way up high

In the mountains.

Insolvent with the dopeman,

So, weigh the love, buy a gram.

On a 15 year old addiction.

Replay the tapes

Sponsored by NannyCam

Caught up in some

Jared Fogel scam.

Residue still on my hands

More than enough for a conviction.

Unwell is an understatment.

Not quite such, the likes of this.

No cures yet, no medicines

For this specific ailment.

Hell-bent for treasures of skin,

New faces and old fetishes.

Tongue in cheek, words of mouth,

Often to leave the lips,

*“Old habits die the hardest.""*

Said the junkie,

Who could never fucking kick it.

346|My First Poem|"He stood along the shore and said  
I do not miss my home  
I do not miss my static life  
I know I'm built to roam.  

He stood in the abyss and thought  
I've never been alone  
I've always had my heart with me  
It's no one's but my own.  

He stood atop the clouds and yelled  
Triumphant as the sun  
I know the darkness fades to day  
I know my heart has won.  

He stood falling, flailing, endlessly  
He'd always been alone  
He knew what he had said was false  
His heart had turned to stone.  

He woke, he saw no helping hands  
Expecting just as much  
Tempting, cursing, denying death  
Refusing any crutch.  

He stood once more no strength remained  
His soles and soul succumb  
His heart of stone lay shattered, still  
His song a beating drum."
347|Maricopa|"**Maricopa**

To live after a storm is to remember

And in remembering the details

They become more vivid,

&#x200B;

Like the way your voice sounded as I complained

About the obscene number of candles

That stood in the cabinetry.

&#x200B;

To survive a storm, is to recall,

Always will you recall these things

And always will these things you see be different.

&#x200B;

Like the way I refuse to name this poem,

Something that makes sense thematically,

Like “*To Survive A Storm”.*

&#x200B;

To survive a storm is to hear the rain,

Always, a soft pitter patter,

Just beyond the horizon, even in its absence.

&#x200B;

Like the way I shoehorn this stanza in,

To fit with the format I’ve set up,

Even when the words I’ve laid forth don’t make any sense within the confines of the narrative

structure.

&#x200B;

To survive a storm is to constantly re-imagine,

The events as if they were yesterday,

And never tell the audience the struggle in any vivid detail.

&#x200B;

Like the way I’m not saying the storm is specifically one thing,

Because to do so would be to detract from the value,

That a non-personal, fluid narrative can bring

To those facing their own storms.

&#x200B;

My storm has long past,

And now I sit on a couch,

Un-moving, in Maricopa.

348|The Color of Lightning is Yellow|"The other day I texted my mom to ask about what I was like as a child.

She answered,

&#x200B;

>“When you were a baby,  
You were happy.  
You always wanted to cuddle, snuggle up.  
You loved to wear dresses & you loved the color yellow.  
You’ve always been scared of storms.”

&#x200B;

She used to tell me the story of a thunderstorm that was extra greedy one night.

That it huffed and puffed hard enough to steal the roof from the hospital I called home.

& it did.

&#x200B;

When I was younger, I was brave enough to fight the boys who made fun of me, but not brave enough to fight the rain alone.

One night, a thunderstorm shook the walls of my yellow room.

The sound of light breaking near my window took away all my bravery.

I took my pillow, crawled underneath my covers & cried & cried until the weight of my comforter held me close to my mattress until I fell asleep.

&#x200B;

A few weeks ago, it rained for days.

The rain did not stop for me & the rain never has & the rain never will; no matter how much I ask for it to stop at the foot of my bed.

The cacophony of water ticking on my window & tree branches scraping the walls will continue to write an unwanted symphony to my ears.

Every time thunder roars & lightning stretches down to touch the earth will be an ode to the kid that will always be here.

&#x200B;

My favorite color was yellow; it was the color of my room and my favorite sundress.

Now it’s some sort of purple, I think.

&nbsp;  
The ice cube has touched my skin,  
has melted down my breasts, and he wants it; before it evaporates  
I think better of putting it back in the glass. I let it melt on his tongue,  
and he thinks he has tasted me. Never once have I wondered  
what a man tastes like, what any man would taste like—I know:  
like skin. It’s simple. I have never written an ode to the idea of genitals  
tasting like something consumable. We put them in our mouths anyway.  
This is what makes it absurd  
when he says, *You smell like vanilla. I want to taste it*, as if it would  
taste the same; in spite of its scent, the taste of perfume is mostly isopropyl.  
I let him think what he will. I am giving him something he thinks is something  
when I’m feeding him water that has touched my skin.

350|Return to Sender|"
I've become addicted

Written up

Evicted

Now I'm left with this sickness

My mind was killed

And I am the witness

I'm the one who did this

I shot the bullet

Then I bit it.

I'm a black out drunk

A good for nothing punk

I fell for the things

That left me in the dump

Now I'm using needles

Used by other people

I'm the second hand

In the clock of life

The rubber band

Cut with a pocket knife

Flashed then trashed

Like a random rash.

Im addicted 

that fact is true

But honestly the thing I'm addicted to

Is the feeling of being wanted by you.

I'm destroyed

Just kidding

I enjoyed

The feeling of being toyed

After all I must 

Cause it seems to happen 

Every time I choose to trust.

So I'll write a letter

And return to sender

And hopefully one day 

The sender will write back one even better.


Dear me

You're being played can't you see?

Sincerely

Me

P.s.

Brain left

Changed his address

Cause he couldn't handle the stress

So if everything is a mess

Then pray to someone to bless

Cause I don't know if I can handle this.

P.p.s.

Brain took heart

And all the rest

So good luck trying to restart

When you have nothing left

Skin and bone

They'll stay home

Cause they're too sick

Brittle and broken

Smashed by brick

After all

Broken bodies can't move one bit.


Splendid

But I hated how it ended

Maybe it's how I read it?

Maybe it's how he said it?

How could brain have fled

He's stuck in a skull of lead

Even if he bled

He's still trapped

Hiding under the bed

Till he bleeds out

From the fear coming out

Cause the real monsters

Aren't under the bed

They're all inside of head.

Research

It hurts

Finding out why

Father suddenly died

Why mother always cried

We aren't rich

But we're getting by.

Things seem fine?

Then I crossed the line

I bypassed rhymes

I wrote this line

I did that crime

I did my time

I paid my dimes

It's not sublime 

But it's life

And now I know

That I strife

Why I hold this knife

Why I hate this life

Cause its not nice.

I'm not gonna sugar coat it

I'm not gonna use that spice

Cause honestly

It's what I despise

Hope that's not a surprise

Just look me in the eyes

Does it seems like a joke?

Did my voice ever choke?

I think not.

So leave me alone.


Dear me

I got your letter

Things have seemed to change

But not for the better.

However 

I didn't need that negativity

So I put it through the paper shredder.

Your self indulging greed

Your self fulfilling need

You turned me into a murder scene

Now it's time I turned the other cheek.

Sincerely 

Me.

P.s.

Brain never left

You walked out on him

You drained him of his grin

Turned his ascension

Into a depression

Nows he's left with skin

Now he's dead within

You're the one who murdered him

You're the one who committed sin

Now he's drowned in gin

Drunk from fights with pins

Stepping on his friends

Looking through their lens

Or through their heads

I guess it depends.

P.p.s

This is Brain

Your made me insane.

You're selfish

You gave me a bad name

You made Satan's flame

Look like a preschool game.

I'm glad I came

But I'm glad I left

Getting this off my chest

Before you kill the rest

P.p.p.s

I would have preferred death.

My boy, a blue-sweater mystery

With bated wonder, the rattle of aspens,

The tire swing symphony.  

He dances over dead leaves,

Prince among fallen attics 

And overgrown ivy. 

My wife turns back, a soft smile--

Hands in her coat, she watches me wisely

As the world is made new.

I don’t hear your voice or recognize your face,

And my heart doesn’t feel all silly.

&#x200B;

In fact, everything stays in place.

&#x200B;

My voice doesn’t crack and my gut doesn’t twist,

My throat doesn’t dry and my head doesn’t ache,

I don’t fiddle with the bracelet on my wrist,

I don’t smile at your smile and my legs don’t shake,

You think I don’t see you and you call out my name,

But I shake my head in sheer disappointment,

As my face doesn’t flush and I don’t feel the same,

I close my eyes for a moment,

And when I open them you’re already gone,

But I see the time and it takes my breath away,

The clock flashes 4:44 before dawn,

My heart stops beating and my tears go astray,

My voice cracks, my gut twists,

My throat dries, my head aches,

And I rest my head on my pillow in defeat,

I lost the record I thought I could keep,

It turns out I never had a chance, 

Not only was I never meant to compete

But we were never meant to meet.

356|I Don't Care/Cool Girl|"*“I don’t care”* 

The first time he says it we are sitting in a baseball diamond and I am asking him what we are approx. 15 minutes before my father wants me home. He says it and I feel my heart drop but I smile instead and let Tove Lo’s “Cool Girl” play in my head as I say, “Neither do I.”

 But the next day, I walk through Marianos feeling as empty as the shopping basket on my left arm. An old man peers between the buttons on my blouse, probably because I don’t have anything on underneath, but I don’t stop him. 

Why?

 Because: *I’m a cool girl, I’m a I’m a cool girl, ice cold, I roll my eyes at you, boy*

&#x200B;

*“I don’t care”*

 The second time he says it, we’re on the I-90. Ten minutes ago, we were in Portage Park and I was forgetting about the galaxy and now I can feel every cosmic flake of every cosmic event coming to a slow broil in my blood.

 *I’ve got fever highs* 

*I’ve got boiling blood* 

*I’m that fire kind* 

We could burn together 

He repeats himself and I want to throw myself out of the car as an act of political protest. I am now an activist, a member of the National Coalition Against Not Caring and yet, I passively open my mouth and said, “Oh. Okay.”

 Like some insecure high school girl who’s convinced herself, at the tender age of 15, that she will die alone because of her acne. Like some insecure high school girl who doesn’t know that there is a world of desperate internet men that would sooner leave their wives than leave her. 

Like one of those desperate men.

&#x200B;

*“I don’t care”* 

There is nothing more agonizing than knowing that you’d pull the stars, piece-by-piece, out of the sky for someone that just doesn’t care. 

*“I don’t care”* 

There is a special agony in belonging to someone that doesn’t belong to you. 

*“I don’t care.”* He says it and I swear I can see something agonistic in his eyes.

&#x200B;

*“I don’t care.”* 

*You can run free.*

 *I won’t hold it against ya.* 

*You do your thing, never wanted a future.* 

*Fuck if I knew how to put it romantic.* 

*Speaking my truth.* 

*There’s no need to panic.* 

If I repeat it enough, maybe I’ll listen.

 We are standing at a parking lot in Woodfield when the record scratches in my head.

Because normal is good

And abnormal is bad

At least to an extent

You are better off sad

Thinking that you are off

While the others are not

You join right in the mob

And you point and you sneer

And you act with dismay

You go home by yourself

And you cry and you say

""That could just have been me

But I'm glad it was you

I'm safe in the many""

361|Mama Said|"#Mama Said

When I was little, mama said  
Clean up your room and make your bed,  
Turn off the lights and close the door,  
Don't drag your backpack on the floor.  
&nbsp;  
Stand up straight with poise and charm!   
(We didn't raise you in a barn!)  
Never beg, and never steal,  
And have some veg with every meal,  
&nbsp;  
Say please and thank you, don't be rude,  
And close your mouth when chewing food.  
Eat everything that's on your plate,  
Arrive on time and don't be late,  
&nbsp;  
Enjoy the things with which you're blessed  
For many get by with much less.  
And to thine heart be always true,  
Don't follow blindly – just be you.  
&nbsp;  
And now that I've grown up a bit  
I've come to more and more admit  
The woman that I am today  
Owes quite a lot to “mama say”.  
&nbsp;  
But mama also told me once  
You're not my daughter, and no son  
Of mine will dress up like a whore  
And prance around in frilly drawers  
&nbsp;  
Then somehow think he's worthy of  
A mother's sure and certain love.  
So listen to your momma, girls–  
But toss the shells... and keep the pearls.

*Author's Note*: this is a rough-edit draft.  That means that, although it's been through the Brutal Edit Machine™ once or twice, the final result is still very much in flux. I'm putting this out there more in the hopes that others can help workshop the basic premise of the idea, and give me some feedback on whether the central conceit is worth exploring further.  It is *not* intended to be the final, cut-in-granite, unchangeable fixture of words that I usually present.  With that in mind, thank you for reading, and offering your commentary.  "
364|The Barber|"    The same old question from the barber,
    ""How long since you cut your hair?""
    I was here five weeks ago
    but sat in a different chair.
    
    I sat right here, looked in that mirror
    and had a slightly rounder face,
    because when I was here five weeks ago
    I was in a different place.
    
    I had seventeen more pounds on me
    and must have sat up taller too,
    because when I was here five weeks ago
    I had a different point of view.
    
    If you can take five weeks off me,
    maybe take a little more,
    because when I was here five weeks ago
    there was no blood on Highway Four.
    
    I was still a human being
    and he was still my closest friend.
    Make me who I was five weeks ago.
    Make me who I was back then.

365|"""Best Friends""(free verse I think?) first shot at this since high school so it's sloppy, but it needed to get it off my chest."|"We are best friends.  
Inseparable.   
When only one of us is out, they ask about the missing half.   
We spend an unhealthy amount of time together.  
Just.   
New friends.   
Passing time.   



We get new jobs, but we stay close.   
Our time together goes from daily.   
To weekly.   
To ""brunch every Sunday""  
To ""Oh my God, has it been a month? We can't let that happen again!""  
We will.  
We will have that same.  
Exact.  
Conversation.  
Five times this year.   
But we're busy with  
New friends  
Passing time.  



One of us will call every week or so.  
Intending to get together.  
We're busier now.  
Demanding workloads.  
New friends.  
Passing time.  



We'll bump into each other at the same local places we used to frequent.  
We'll fight over buying the next round, and joke about how  
It was so different Back then.  
We introduce our new friends and lovers, looking for approval.  
The introductions stop.  
We hug when we see each other.  
Then we wave.   
Then we act like we don't see each other, and enjoy our meal with  
New friends.  
Passing time.  



We see each other's cars around town and.  
We wave.  
One day, we get new ones.  
The waving stops.  
Businesses  
New friends  
Passing time.  



One of us gets married.  
We're there.  
Sort of.  
We shake hands of friends we used to know.  
We text our date it's time to go.  
We leave the gift we just picked up.  
We sipped enough champagne to meet your  
New friends  
Passing time.  



Congratulations!  
We text you on the day your first is born.  
We aren't there.  
It would have been weird.  
What's the baby's name again?  
What color balloon do we send?  
Families  
New friends.  
Passing time.  



It's been years.  
We see each other at the store.  
One of us is just back to visit parents  
They're getting older  
Sometimes they ask about you.  
How old is the baby?  
Seven. We're headed to see their  
New friends  
Passing time.  



Our kids are graduating.  
We see each other at the ceremony.  
We wave.  
The kids ask us who we are.  
Nobody.  
They run to their  
New friends.  
Passing time.  



I wonder How they've been?  
Sick  
Older  
Surrounded by family and friends.  
Except one.  
The kids are looking through your old photos with you.  
Who is that?  
You read the obituaries.  
You almost forgot they existed.  
I guess they don't anymore.  
You cry at the funeral.  
The kids had to ask.  
Who was that?  



We were best friends  
Inseparable.  
When only one of us is out, they would ask about the missing half.  
We spent an unhealthy amount of time together.  
Just  
New friends  
Passing time.

366|The morning after she leaves you|"&nbsp;

the first thing you will think of will be her shoulder blades


and how they responded in unison to each meticulous


heave and sigh that left her lips


you will stare at the ceiling and think about


how too many times you let


yourself win in an argument.


how, even after your business trips, 


you were too tired to brush a strand of her


hair back or at least pretend to care.


now, you must practice the art of dismembering


pieces of her in the tiny nook set out for reading


and in the colors of your shower curtains


like repeatedly ripping velcro 


off of the heart you thought she would spend


an eternity in.

367|The girl in my class|"    This is my poem to a girl in my class
    Who sits and listens with such passionate interest
    Overtaken by shyness she never participates
    She reads her poetry book and takes notes on her favorites
    The person I want to be is shown through her intelligence
    Deeply jealous of her, but my love takes precedence
    So this is my poem to the girl in my class
    In my dreams we spoke for the first time at last
    Never will I work up the courage to speak
    But in another reality I'm not so fucking weak

368|On Drinking Underage|"Two words repeating over and over  
rock bottom rock bottom rock bottom  
it’s my eighth shot of crown in half an hour,  
tell me baby, do you feel dangerous, reckless,  
do you feel like the whole world is turning against you  
underneath the stars as you throw back another shot  
laughter all around but only silence ringing through your ears  
Chocolate and whiskey lingering on my tongue  
from the night I tried to drink away my demons  
the night I broke down and told you I loved you, the night you just said “I know”  
all I could think was “I am in love with you,   
you are going to break me and I am going to let you”  
Baby, drunk tongues speak sober thoughts  
It burned my mouth the first time you kissed me  
fireball and rum and your lips against mine  
it felt like heaven but hurt like hell  
because I knew it was just alcohol and loneliness  
but my god, I’ll never forget your hand on the back of my neck  
and the love story your tongue told mine

I agree. What I don't love

is punctuating a paragraph

silver shelves

tucked under chairs

bare because books put there

staccato, like an over-punctuated

Will the metal hearts rise;

When I’m dancing with ghosts?


I know times flying by

With every last note

My prime will die

Sooner than I know


But bright wide eyes

Will fill my heart with hope

And join me in the sky

Where we’ll dance with ghosts

Nice is inaccurate

Nice is insulting

Nice is helping your mother bring in groceries

Nice is holding the door open for a stranger

She was art

She was beauty incarnate

She was the medium manifested right before your eyes

She was a bountiful blend of every palette

She was art

Just looking at her evoked a gambit of feelings

Joy and despair

Completeness and intrigue

She gave you the sensation of satisfaction and discontent simultaneously

Because that’s what art does

And she was art

Your only desire in that one moment of witnessing her beauty

Wasn’t to live a long and prosperous life

Wasn’t for higher degrees of achievement

No

Your touch would only ruin her

Ruin her beauty

373|Suicide Credit|"These synthetic lights are too loud

The microphone keeps 
threatening to take off my head

I don’t want to be 
a part of this cast anymore

The script is grim, defected
infecting my nights as I fixate
on the plot, which baffles me
with it’s steady flow of crisis 

The director keeps demanding 
dramatic theatricals from me

We rehearsed this particular scene
a few dozen times

I’m in an airport terminal

A woman bears to me grave news
of a man, who has drowned himself

Screeches erupt from the mouth of a child

End scene

Now the final production has been released

I’m sitting in the audience

My life is happening on the screen

There are earthquakes in my veins

Rolls the credits

But don’t give me credit for this

374|"""Sunday Supper"""|"    I wake to the dawn  

    of man’s last day.  

    I will place  

    his last meal before him,  

    cornbread, potato salad,  

    two whole, fried birds,  

    the skin still blistering  

    from the bubbling lard.  

    I’ll watch him eat alone,  

    like a maître d’ dressed  

    as a prison guard,  

    as his teeth tear  

    the flesh from the breastbone.  


    Then I’ll bring  

    the preacher man to say  

    grace, a few words about  

    forgiveness, watch  

    him read from the book  

    about plagues and first born  

    killings to someone  

    who buried his father’s  

    hunting knife clean to the hilt  

    in the abdomen  

    of a pregnant woman.  


    Close to midnight,  

    a family will gather  

    round the table and marvel  

    at the lovely spread.  

    They’ll watch me strap  

    him down and the doctors fix  

    him up with tubes. Chemicals will flow  

    and his eyes will drift  

    down like torsos on the riverbed. It will  

    be orderly and ceremonious  

    and he will shit all over himself.  


    Blood that’s spilled blood  

    is spilled, fair and just like

375|The Elephant in the Room|"Is it possible to sleepwalk if you are wide awake?

To shuffle past our problems while insisting they are fake?

What’s this collective apathy that’s spreading like a plague,

Spurning facts for fictions and making specifics vague?

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

The media dilutes the truth and spins the other way,

Making a fuss, dividing us, while on our fears they prey.

There’s clickbait that you can’t believe, ten uses for a lemon!

But please ignore atrocities within the country Yemen.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Why are we always outraged over things which make no sense?

Red starbucks cups and Nike ads? How can we be so **dense**?

Please don’t follow brainless trends, I know it’s become chronic.

Social networks’ circle jerks are tragically ironic.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

This culture is destroying us, it isn’t hard to see.

We’re looking out for number one, it’s always *me, me, me*.

So focused on the short term that we fail to look ahead,

To see the gloom and doom which looms, filling hearts with dread.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“What can we do?” We ask ourselves, “I’m just one person, dude.”

“Besides I’m comfy on my couch, everyone *else* is screwed.”

History would be different, if our forefathers sighed,

And paid the tax on British tea, letting the whole thing slide.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Get off your couch and make some change! Don’t just like or share.

People will scroll past your attempts without a second’s care.

Stop listening to screaming screens and switch off, think a while.

Without being told what you should feel, at last you’re free to smile.

We gladly work the livelong day to please our lovely Queen!”  


I glared at them in sheer disgust. “You little fools!”, I thought.  
“You sweat and toil and break your backs, but all of it’s for naught.  
For your dear Queen sits on her bum inside her little hill.  
She has you at her beck and call. You must obey her will.”  


“You have no voice! You have no clout! You have no time to play!  
What wretched little lives you lead!”, I snorted in dismay.  
“You’re nothing but a bunch of slaves, you mindless little fools!  
You have a swarm mentality that binds you to the rules!”

380|Pineapple|"#Pineapple

I brought it home  
And there it sat:   
A pineapple   
So green and fat.   
&nbsp;  
I placed it on  
My windowsill   
Until the day      
I'd eat my fill.   
&nbsp;  
“But it's not ripe!  
I must delay!   
I'll cut it up   
Another day.”   
&nbsp;  
A couple days...  
They came and went.  
A weekend passed.   
New Year's. Then Lent.   
&nbsp;    
That pineapple   
Still wasn't ripe –   
“I'll eat it up    
Some other night.”   
&nbsp;  
For three whole years   
That's what I said.   
“One day, one day   
Before I'm dead.”    
&nbsp;  
From time to time   
I'd glance its way…   
“Someday I will.   
Someday. Someday.”   
&nbsp;  
I married once.   
Divorced him twice.   
That damn pineapple    
Stayed unripe!  
&nbsp;  
My kids grew old   
And left the nest   
And still, it wasn't   
Ready yet.   
&nbsp;  
“I'll get to you,”   
I said again.   
But there were bills   
And jobs. And then...   
&nbsp;  
As suddenly    
As it began,   
I didn't have    
a single plan,   
&nbsp;   
Not even one   
Red-circled date!   
No duties. None.   
A clean, white slate.   
&nbsp;   
So now, at last!   
Today's the day!   
I reached and found   
My sharpest blade    
&nbsp;   
And took the fruit   
Down from its shelf,   
Where it spent years   
All by itself.   
&nbsp;   
But as I sliced   
Into its rind–   
That pineapple...   
Was brown inside.      
&nbsp;   
Turns out, the one   
That wasn't ripe   
Was me,         
My whole, entire life.

381|Upon seeing you rise to leave|"The stone is not the beauty of the sculpture

382|eat the sky|"#“eat the sky”


On my 10th birthday,  
I tried to fit the sky in my mouth.  
I parted my lips, wrapped them  
around the blunt end of a cloud  
&nbsp;  
and chewed. I clutched at  
the air by the fistful,  
pushing it past my teeth,  
onto my tongue, and down my throat.  
&nbsp;  
When I finished with the cloud,  
I shimmied up the trunk of a tree  
and plucked the sun  
from its home like an apple.  
&nbsp;  
I ate it in three greedy gulps and   
climbed higher, even as its lemon  
juices squirmed down my chin  
and stained the front of my t-shirt.  
&nbsp;  
Halfway up, I spied a comet  
racing away like a squirrel.  
I caught it by the tail and licked my lips.  
It popped and crunched  
&nbsp;  
On my palate like the caramel corn  
daddy bought me once at the circus.  
I pushed with my toes, and though  
the bark scraped my knees,  
&nbsp;  
I climbed higher still.  
The moon was next, and her stars.  
I scooped them all up in my palms  
like trail-mix, as I watched  
&nbsp;  
the neighbor boy finish mowing the lawn  
and put old man Palmer’s machine away.  
I enjoyed the way his back muscles rippled  
in the dwindling starlight.   
&nbsp;  
I tossed Polaris and the Pleiades  
in my mouth, one at a time,  
completing my work, even as  
he completed his.   
&nbsp;  
My belly now distended like a pregnant mother,   
I unhinged my jaw and belched.  
And an orchestra of river and light  
poured out of me,    
&nbsp;    
and filled the space around my body.    
And then I jumped.    
&nbsp;    
Because there were acorns  
for the things that scurry in the fields.  
&nbsp;  
And boldly striped tents for the things   
that roar and bellow in the night.   
&nbsp;  
And sheds for the things  
that whirr and clank in young boys hands.  
&nbsp;  
But there was no more sky for little girls  
who dream of tasting it.

383|For those who shop at Aldi|"Liquids first, that's clever planning,  
In the face of frenzied scanning,  
Hands with cracked and faded polish  
Strive to dent and fling, demolished, 

 

All your goods like it's a race,  
The chequered flag? That tiny space  
That's barely fit to house a flea,  
Which quickly fills with packs of tea,

  

And foreign fruits preserved in brine,  
Inexpensive German wines,  
Saw-blades, socks and radish jam,  
Frozen custard, legs of lamb,  



Curried crisps and loaves of rye,  
Easter eggs, a gin-soaked pie,  
Treadmills, snowboards, sacks of spices,  
Christmas trees at crazy prices!  



You steal a glance at the cashier,  
Your eyes all wide and full of fear,  
But they look down and carry on,  
Brain-dead, vague, automaton.  



Those behind you wear a frown,  
Because they know you've let them down,  
But soon their frowns will disappear:  
They'll share the fate, you've suffered here.

387|93014 - Evolution|"But maybe snow is just angels flicking ashes from their cigarettes down to earth. 

And the days we spend home from work playing in powdered crystals will leave us coughing up smoke after we turn 16. 

And the light pink dress my mother used to make me wear will turn red where it hits my hips and kisses the tips of my wrists. 

And my mother will ask me why there’s blood on my clothing.
 
And I'll pretend like I haven’t been doing drugs in the bathroom and crying so much. 

And one of these days I’ll scream at you to kiss me and you’ll do it and we’ll both burn into the ground and watch our bones melt into nothing because we are nothing even though we’ve got ourselves convinced that we’re the world. 

But at least your lips are against mine. 

And you don’t always feel it at first but when you feel it. 

Oh god. 

You feel it. 

And liquor seems like a good idea until it’s not. 

And you’ll get better at feeling sorry for yourself. 

And bandaging my cuts. 

And I’ll get better at finding the stars under your skin. 

And we'll be learning to breathe again. 

And you’ll lose your fucking mind but you’ll find it. 

Again. 

And again. 

And I’m terrified of growing up. 

And leaving behind chapped lips and peach tasting kisses. 

Fireworks and headaches. 

But to see your eyes filled with the oceans pouring down your face and flooding your mouth. 

Makes me realize that I want to drown in you. 

I don't want to run away blindly. 

But I would go anywhere with you.

389|If you find a flower in your library book|"*forgive the sloppy formatting, I'll correct it when I'm not on mobile*

her thigh high socks were an rsvp to    
a sad book club in the library downtown    
where she pulled me down an empty aisle    
and cried as she kissed my neck.     
we held hands in the world war II
section    
and she said i was the wrong    
kind of idiot and that our days    
were digits at the bottom of the page    


february meant we quit the job where we met. somehow it was okay,     
and i met her family by accident.     
i slept at her parent's house    
for an entire week without them knowing.    
she laughed when I hid under her sheets     
and had to borrow her t-shirts.    
i picked flowers from her backyard    
and she pressed them in her library books.     
her eyes told me the flowers     
were better off with her     


she stole some pills from her sister    
and we never really slept,    
just fell on top of each other in whichever    
room we had torn apart last.     
none of the black curtains in her room    
even had a window underneath    
and i wondered if a sleepy cigarette death     
would be our only relief that night    


""you're a peach"" she said    
 as i held the door for her. we found    
 a maintenance hallway perfect for sneaking     
into the movie theater after it had closed.      
it would be just one of    
a hundred binge fog memories that week.     
we sat in the empty theater,     
second row from the top    
surrounded by empty chairs,    
barely breathing.    
in that vacuum of senses,     
she broke her voice, severe as burning books -    


""only an idiot holds himself back    
for someone who doesn't mind      
being unknowable""    


""don't you put that on me"" i sighed     
at the shadow of the face i might've lost    


she bit her lip. ""i haven't,"" she lied    
and left through the fire exit.

390|The way she is now|"the way she is now:  
twenty-three years and I know people  
change, but she changed  
from jalapeños and tequila

asking me to taste her.  
&nbsp;  
the way she is now:  
three months since I last touched land,

391|Which Deities Prefer Orange Blossom Tea?|"The sunset is caramel dripping down the buildings  
And I am willing to bet  
That the grass smells nothing like your fingers catching on my cheek when you pinned me down  
On the mossy clover hill behind the church last summer.  

I am willing to bet  
That this sidewalk is the wrong kind of rough on my bare heels,  it must not heat up the same way it used to  
That the wind won't blow my skirt up no matter how many times
I wear that peach stained dress again.

And you can bet I'd be willing  
To take the grimy, soggy train tickets I crumpled in my fist as we ran through the sweaty pink evening just in time to miss the train,  
Cover them with orange blossom tea dregs,  
Make a sacrifice and summon the gods responsible  
For Sunday coming after Saturday and you leaving for school on Monday  
And for this lonely fall.

392|You Made Me Shake Her Hand And Now Mine Are Sticky|" 

Do you think her kisses taste like helium?  
Do you get lifted off your toes when you see her, your heart ascending to meet hers in a solar cadenza?   
When her hair moves and the light hits it a certain way, can you tell it’s woven with bits of wheat and prairie grass?   
Are her fingers always this sticky with maple syrup, sugar leaking out of every pore, embalmed in vestal amber sap?

While my knuckles bled and my fingertips blistered, while I fell on my knees and trenched them to free the twisted cartilage inside, ripped pages out of books for attention, clanged pots and pans together and built bonfire skeletons from sonnets, wedging them under my bed instead, she waited

She’s here now, she’s arrived and she’s staying because she is molasses and i’m vinegar at best.

393|Bad Dreams Poem|"They shot my horse and I could not stop them.  
I could not stop the pink matter from leaping from her

I want to remember the sound she made  
the sound I made, the horror a ball in my mouth,  
but it was cold  
and we had fallen so quickly.  

I put her head in my lap and held her there  
the big, precious clover of her muzzle,  
stroking it softly:  
the kind of touch you inherit and  
hand down in only the most delicate moments—   

She gave me the rest of the warmth that was fleeing her;  
even her eyes, which still loved me,   
burned in the darkness.

394|Collateral Damage|"There's a melancholy your memory left behind.

Like one sole violin damned to play the same song till its strings snap.

Like drowning in desperation as I watched it all fall apart and leave only coffee grinds. 

There's a part of me that cannot forget, it keeps reminding me, like a knock on the door with a rhythmic tap. 

God, I'm trying, I am. 

Is it cliche if I say my heart is lonely? 

Like it's surrounded by millions of others beating in time, but I can only ever hear my own. 

Like I'm deaf to everyone but the sound of your voice, if not yours, then my heart only. 

That's the catch, you and my heart are strung together, sewn.

God, I'm trying, I am.

I didn't know I knew, not until the salty taste of my tears reached my lips. 

Like hoping a rose will survive as you watch it's last petal fall. 

Like being 20 feet below water and being okay with drowning at your fingertips. 

I keep silently repeating the words in the note you wrote me when you finally left, I can hear it in my head like your voice in our last call.

""God, I'm trying, I am"".

I was a million miles away

From losing you.

Traversing all this distance

Has taught me something new:

Millions of miles exist

In which I have a perfect view.

&nbsp;

I see the smiles you have.

I see the things you do:

The things you used to do

When you were me,


And I was you.

So now a million miles away,

In perfectionist display,

I see you every day,

And I miss your every way,

But no longer are you she:


The she I thought I knew

A million miles ago,

When you were me,


And I was you.

And we were us.

396|You|"	You were a soft blur in everyday sight.

you left a sweet scent when you passed by me

that masked your mysterious identity

like a shadow impervious to light.

I only caught you with my fleeting eye

your quaint stare fixed on the stars in the sky

yet, you were still a blur, but you were quite

the one person who fueled my delight.

&#x200B;

	You were a sharp smudge in those works of Art

imperfect, but perfection struck your heart  

I could see your passion in those fingers--

when they moved, mere idleness broke apart

I was moved by it, and that was the start

of why your blurred image that still lingers

Now jolted my impassioned hands to paint

The picture of your smile that was still faint.

&#x200B;

	You were a flash of lightning by the moon

that I, perhaps, touched by its frantic tail

and sent to your domain through a starry trail

a dimension of shapeless lights that attune

to the music released by your sweet voice,

like refreshing rain that calms the summer

or spring’s smooth winds singing me to slumber

and dream in nights where my love could rejoice.

&#x200B;

	You were a color within the dawn,

the morning Sun resplendent in your glance

awakening a sound that was long gone--

Hope, that chorus of God divinely done,

I could hear its phantom tunes within you dance

I could see them scatter and cover the world

The bright color of dawn ere me unfurled

and you I could finally grasp, perchance.

&#x200B;

	But, you were a twilight in Paradise

when sunset triumphs over the sunrise

and the last color of the glorious morn

quickly escapes, and leaves the night forlorn.

A vestige of a masterpiece, a ghost

of a sentiment that filled me the most

with much passion, that I forgot the fear

Of knowing one day you will disappear.

&#x200B;

	You are a shadow cast upon my road

a darkness in my silent solitude,

when in lonely days I heave Sorrow’s load

The bitter fate of Life I understood:

The every detail of your happy face

Your loving ways, I can never erase

But, the roads move always, so I must too

Maybe, I will forget all about ***you****.*

I swallowed lies ancient, as old as human history  

I always had a feeling, is this really all there is?  

 I felt a gnawing doubt that I was living in anothers dream  

I cast aside all I knew, I threw away the mask they gave me  

I threw away the me they told me I must strive to be  

Naked in my aloneness I saw my trusty Self  

The face behind the mask was faceless, unnamed and unborn, absolutely fathomless, open like the blue sky  

Bodiless I was, of mind there was no notion of  

Neither was the time ticking, nor was there matter to be seen  

Yet I reigned high and mighty, all I saw was I alone

A fact you should know about chameleons,

is that they never stick!

Put the word dog in a mirror

Religion? Terror.

Please my saviour 

Send me to hell

Stock my sockets

arrayed in solid quietude.  

The clouds leaked onto the prairie

405|a letter to my unborn child.|"The purest and most tender love I have ever felt was for you.

Your power over me was so strangely foreign,

yet oh so welcomed. 

You, young one, took priority.

Online articles told me 

what to eat.

what to wear.

what to expect.

Changes to my body were quick and fierce

Swollen. Tender. Tired.

You, a constant in my mind,

Like the ebb and flow of life and death.

But, unfortunately you shared this space

with another constant.

A constant that sprung his head upon your arrival

Intense. Fragile. Angry.

Voices told me you weren't good for me, and

like a puppet on a tight thread, I obeyed.

I became too sick, too frightened, too alone.

The Puppet Master pulled on the string, and

like a bullseye arrow despair struck me.

A life permanently snuffed out.

Panic. Lonely. Weak.

It is only in the aftermath that I realized I will never hear

your voice,

your laugh,

your cries.

Since you were apart of me, I can only hope

that you knew I never meant for this to happen. 

The lakes would be jealous of the oceans my heart has wept for you,

and where you once were only a giant hole remains.

Guilt. Guilt. Guilt.

406|I lost someone very important. Here’s what I wrote.|"Smell of blood

Lurked in my room

The night was dark

Without any clues

Among

Broken

Pieces.

Needless to say i was helpless.

I was there in my room with the bitter smell of blood

The universe slowly passed by

With a cacophony of stars in sight

A hint of blue, a stroke of red

The terrifying beauty of the starry mess.

I didn’t say anything

I was just looking up to blank nothingness

A blade in my hand

Dancing

A childish pleasure

Scattered across the endless night going nowhere but the border of my whole falling universe.

And it fell

Fell

Down to the stained sheets

The night ran along my shoulders like a naughty kid

The blade was sitting there

Cold as ice

As it faded away, no where in sight

I didn’t care.

I’d done enough

I’d had the whole universe in my palm

It was illuminating

Yet i couldn’t get a grip of it

And it slipped away

Dazzling with schadenfreude

Like a swaying boat on a stormy day.

What I could lost, I had lost

It all went South

But little did I know, something stayed.

A lonely remaining star

A swirl of space dust

It held on to me, desperate, like it’ll die for me if it must

And i smiled at that star

As i let it go

Cause no one ever deserves to stay inside this sufferer’s palm

For as little as a second.

Leaving fingerprints on the pendant.

Because it’s something you won’t do.

Because nine was just a square!

418|The ABCs According to Me|"Why must the grass be colored green?  
The sky be painted blue?  
Who says that pigs must say, ""Oink! Oink!""  
Why can't they say, ""Moo! Moo!""  


Why can't I make my oranges blue  
And paint my apples pink?  
Or call my rose another name,  
Like ""dandy doodlewink?""  


I want to hum a different tune    
And sing a brand new song.  
I want to think outside the box.  
How can that be so wrong?  


So here's what I am gonna do  
It's gonna be so neat!  
I'm gonna write a brand-new book  
Of brand-new ABCs.  

My A won't stand for apple.  
My B wont be a bed.  
I'm gonna make my alphabet  
An artist's sketch instead.  


I'll turn my letters left or right  
Or even upside down,  
And then I'll draw the picture  
My imagination found.  


The only rule I'll follow.  
The rule I will not break.  
My picture's name won't start off  
With the sound the letter makes.  

Soooo.....  


My A will be a candy corn.  
My B will be two teeth.  
My C becomes a person's ear.  
My D a toilet seat!  

My E's (of course) a window.  
My F a small bookshelf.  
My G becomes an earring.  
My H? A buckled belt!  

My I will be a pencil.  
My J a fishing hook.  
My K looks like a see-saw.  
My L becomes a book!  

My M will be a spider.  
My N a castle tower.  
My O will be a clown's nose.  
I'll make my P a flower!  


A Q looks like a pig's butt  
(You know it really does!)  
My R becomes a lawn mower.  
My S? A braided rug!  


My T? An old antenna.  
My U? A golden chain.  
My V is an umbrella.  
My W? Two fangs!  

My X? A person being frisked.  
My Y becomes a tree.  
My Z will be a box top.  
And there's MY ABCs!.

419|95 male, white, senile degeneration of the brain, 2 months|"The first month I visited Larry every Friday.  
We spent those cool fall nights  
with the heat on  
in his daughter’s living room watching jeopardy.

&nbsp;

His shrunken body sunk into an over-sized recliner.  
I sat next to him  
on the couch.  
I remember the wisp of white hair on his head.  
That first month he didn’t say much.

Larry didn’t really  
care for jeopardy,  
or television,  
or anything, really, he said.  
Except for Jesus.

&nbsp;

So one Friday night I turned off the TV    
and we listened to “Hallelujah.”
  
Buckley’s voice belting  
from an electronic speaker 

about broken love  
and holy doves  
and Larry nodded his head.

Then he looked over at me  
with pale blue eyes  
and told me secrets;
 
&nbsp;

*Don’t be one thing one time and something else the next,*  
*be steadfast in your walk and in your life.*  
*Even though the world may reject you and you may be mocked and scorned,*  
*yet,*  
*it will be worth it all.*

&nbsp;

Larry told me that his daughter’s husband turned the TV up too loud.  
Larry told me he never once had taken a vitamin.  
Larry told me he loved the Lord.  
Larry told me he felt alone.  
Larry told me

&nbsp;

*Sometimes we get so busy with the little cares of our lives*  
*that we don’t really know people*  
*the way we should;*  
*especially family.*  

*It’s up to us to cultivate relationships,*  
*but we’re often too busy with our own*  
*little*  
*cares.*

&nbsp;

Larry usually finished his thoughts with

&nbsp;

*but, I don’t know. I don’t know.*

&nbsp;

I went to see Larry the day before he died.  
I held a straw to his lips  
as he swallowed a few final drips  
of ice water.
  
His daughter told me that he was close.

He took my hand and looked into my eyes.  
Something pulled me in  
to those pools of blue  
and I melted.

An invisible line  
held us  
as I saw him fade  
slowly  

into eternity.

&nbsp;

Hallelujah.

&nbsp;

And then he said,

&nbsp;
  
*One glimpse of his dear face, and all sorrows erase.*

&nbsp;

He said something else, but I didn’t write it down.  
I wish I had written it down.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

I'm a hospice volunteer and this is based on one of my experiences with a patient. The title contains a few pieces of information from the sheet we get.  Name has been changed for confidentiality as well as a couple of minor details. 

Larry was my first “home-care” case meaning that I didn’t visit him in  hospital.  I visited him at his daughter’s house and we would just hang out and eat ice cream, listen to music, or read the Bible together.  I spent most every Friday night last fall hanging out with him.  He was a cool guy. RIP Larry.

&nbsp;&nbsp;around myself. Steam drifts slowly   


&nbsp;&nbsp;from my body like 8 grams of soul   


&nbsp;&nbsp;departing.   


&nbsp;&nbsp;  


&nbsp;&nbsp;Peel exactly one sheet of two-ply

&nbsp;&nbsp;up and down with practiced

&nbsp;&nbsp;heavily.  


&nbsp;&nbsp;  


&nbsp;&nbsp;They say at the end of the day   


&nbsp;&nbsp;all a man ever really has is   


&nbsp;&nbsp;his word, and a woman   


&nbsp;&nbsp;her reputation, so my   


&nbsp;&nbsp;face bears the cratered terrain   


&nbsp;&nbsp;of a life's reputation earned   


&nbsp;&nbsp;brutally.

&nbsp;&nbsp;Grasp a hunk of mouse-brown hair   


&nbsp;&nbsp;in my fist and drag the brush through   


&nbsp;&nbsp;the ends. I have no idea if this is   


&nbsp;&nbsp;how you do it; mom never taught me,    


&nbsp;&nbsp;never braided me in pigtails   


&nbsp;&nbsp;or pulled it back in a pony. Never   


&nbsp;&nbsp;bothered.   


&nbsp;&nbsp;  


&nbsp;&nbsp;Yank through a knot with all the   


&nbsp;&nbsp;subtlety of a boxer, because that's   


&nbsp;&nbsp;what I was trained to do. Fight the   


&nbsp;&nbsp;world, beat it back from the doorstep,   


&nbsp;&nbsp;never give them the upperhand,   


&nbsp;&nbsp;and don't let them see you   


&nbsp;&nbsp;cry.   


&nbsp;&nbsp;  


&nbsp;&nbsp;Count the hairs trapped between the   


&nbsp;&nbsp;tines. Three, four, five.  No, six. More   


&nbsp;&nbsp;than yesterday.  Pop three pills in   


&nbsp;&nbsp;my grimace and hope for the best.  


&nbsp;&nbsp;Maybe there will be fewer   


&nbsp;&nbsp;tomorrow.

424|You Said That You Liked To Peel Oranges|"You said that you liked peeling oranges  

Liberating the fragile life that’s been walled off  

I said that it seemed intrusive  

You said that it was satisfying  

That one day you just realize you are an adult  

And you go to work and you go to the store  

And you see all of these people despairingly disconnected  

Desolately walled off  

And you remember the warm embrace of your mother  

And the loving touch of her hands  

And you wonder why that went away  

And you want so badly to replace it  

To be acknowledged more deeply than a passing glance  

 And you wonder if anyone else feels the same way  

Then you see a wall  

But it’s different than the others  

And you want to be on the other side  

So your nail scrapes the skin  

And there is an exhalation of vapor  

A burst of luminous droplets  

And it burn your eyes  

But through your tears  

You see the fragile life  

That’s been walled off

425|An Open Letter to the Girl in My Bed|"

&nbsp;

An Open Letter to the Girl in My Bed

&nbsp;

Remember when you asked if you could kiss me?  

The light in my head went off.

We broke the barrier of friendship

and for the first time in a long time I felt hope

I guess my hopes were too high

When I realized 

You were still hers.

&nbsp;

Remember when you threw yourself at me?  

The animal in my guts roared.  

We broke through the door to my bedroom 

and for the first time in a long time I felt passion  

I guess there was too much passion  

Because I forgot to ask if  

You were still hers.

&nbsp;

Remember when I put a stop to this?

My conscience betrayed my needs.

I broke off whatever you want to call this

and for the first time in a long time I felt guilt

I guess there was too much guilt

Because I hated that

You were still hers.

&nbsp;

Remember when we pretended we never had that conversation?

My body overtook my mind

We broke the promise to stay just friends

and for the first time in a long time I didn't care

I guess I didn't care too much

Because I didn't bother asking if

You were still hers.

&nbsp;

I know it hasn't been long but:

Remember when you fell asleep in my bed?

You're still sleeping there now

I broke off alone to go and think

and for the first time in a long time I feel content

I guess I feel a little too content

Because I finally know that

You aren't still hers—

&nbsp;

—But you aren't mine either.

And maybe you never will be.

Maybe you're only using me, but I need you to hear this:

I know I'm nothing to you but

You make me feel alive

Even if it's all a lie.

She brought beer

I drank gin

And vodka

And the beer

&nbsp;

I wish too

I wish she

Didn’t make me

Thirsty 

With her souvenir 

That beer

Our fears

Our tears

*What the fuck is wrong with you?*

It’s 5:30

Too early for me

But now I can’t sleep

I have to pee

I’m thirsty

Thirsty

Always thirsty

*I don’t know why you always do this*

*I dun – I dunno either baby...*

&nbsp;

But she knows

And I know

She’s thirsty too

She drinks me

I taste like beer

She’s still here

I used to push you on a seat of rubber

The grins you used to give your mother

The creak back and forth hitting the lumber

As you grew older, we didn't mean to smother

We wanted you to be happy like when you were younger

Was it our fault? We still wonder

To walk into your room, where I discover

Your body still swinging, like in summer"

432|Can I leave my anxiety in Kansas City?|"A week in LA didn’t do it.

Tacos, Runyon Canyon, edibles, wine, sunshine.

And I still feel the same sense of dread coming home.

""Go to Kansas City for a day.""

They say.

A dinner at a steakhouse and a morning meeting. 

Maybe I’ll wander around, eat barbecue and look for the ghost of George Brett.

Maybe in Kansas City I’ll feel what I didn’t in:

Reno.

Vegas.

Miami.

Home.

Maybe Kansas City is the secret temple within which waits the grail, unguarded and ready to be grasped.

Maybe I can leave it all there and come home free and easy.

All the small choices that seem so hard, all the dread will have no seat on the flight home.

I worked so hard to learn how the world works and acquire this cosmic knowledge, but it was all too much, the only thing you learn when you have learned everything is that nothing matters.

But maybe I’ll forget there.

And I’ll come home a new man.

And the shadow will stay behind with George Brett.

435|Loneliness|"&#x200B;

Loneliness hits in waves

Crashing upon the heart like a bullet when you least expect it

The impact soon spreads to the brain

Riddled with self-doubt, you think if you are worth it

“What are you doing wrong?”

You could be sitting alone at night

You could be talking with a friend

But the gun always seems to fire, and the impact always seems to occur

Everlasting hurt your soul is subject to bear

Sometimes further isolation can happen

And sometimes you can surround yourself with friends

But regardless of the balm applied to this perpetual wound the pain can be felt

Loneliness hits in waves

436|My Da's the Guy What Cuts Down Trees|"#My Da's The Guy What Cuts Down Trees 
*by L.F. Call*
*****

My da's the guy what cuts down trees.  
The biggest lumberjack you'll see.  
And I come up just to his knees:  
The youngest of my brothers.  
There's six of us young men all told,  
And we are brave and we are bold.  
We help our da out in the cold  
And look out for each other.  

&nbsp;  

And every time we cut one down  
My da would gather us around  
And take his rope and tie it down  
And walk off eighty paces.  
Then hand the other end to us,  
And link us up to form a truss  
Strong enough to make his cuts  
While we securely brace it.  

&nbsp;  

The plan was simple. Cut and pull.  
We'd memorized it all in full,  
And strained like several angry bulls    
Against the stubborn timber.  
But every time, that tree would fall  
The other way! And short or tall,  
Among the forest floor we'd sprawl  
With arms and legs akimbo.  

&nbsp;  

*""Is everyone back there okay?  
You boys did nothing wrong,""* he'd say.  
*""That one just fell t’ other way.  
Sometimes it happens sudden.""*  
But I knew what the problem was,  
And it ain't to do wi' the six of us.  
The culprit is so obvious.  
***My da just sucks at cuttin'.***

And no diazepam 


I made a profile,

Swiped left and right 

to find the perfect guy 

Someone who could keep me warm

and satisyfed and high 


After 14 dates and not much luck 

I had a one night stand. 

 I walk of shamed myself back home

pack of valium in hand.


I picked up pizza, popped some pills, 

watched a horror film or two.

but the gentle buzz was not enough

For all I want is you.


so I’m banging for Benzos 

seeking hugs and drugs in bed 

I need pills and thrills

For against my will

You still occupy my head 



I’m banging for Benzos

come back and misbehave

You can steal my cigs, I need a fix 

for you’re all I really crave.

442|all there is|"And yes we may wander;

the gap between us grows to an abyss.

The trees lose their leaves and grow them again

to fill the emptiness that

barren branches bring.

And although I cannot bring forth your fingertips,

if I shut my eyes at the right time in the night,

you are holding my hand beneath a street lamp sky.

They say the world is bigger than this but

I don't believe it.

I know these alleyways like an alphabet.

I have stumbled through these streets with you

like a newborn calf,

slowly learning what it means to roam.

These nights,

this city,

spilled wine:

we both know this is

all there is.

445|Circles and Squares (a poem in verse)|"## Circles and Squares

#### Haley Walker

I live in a world full of circles and squares  

And most of them live without fret.  

Like slinkies that glide down most any old stairs,  

They're happy with what they can get.

&nbsp; &nbsp; But stumble I do and fall flat on my side,  

&nbsp; &nbsp; To waddle across that big gaping divide.  

Because, as you see, I was born as a square,  

And for that I'm sadly upset.  

&nbsp;

I live in a world full of circles and squares  

That think that there's nothing between.  

Though circles and squares have so much that they share,  

They always entirely lean.

&nbsp; &nbsp; I round out my corners and practise to roll.  

&nbsp; &nbsp; I pad up my edges and wall 
up my soul.  

Though my friends assure me, it feels so unfair  

Inside, to myself, I feel mean.  

&nbsp;

I live in a world full of circles and squares.  

The heart of mine just wouldn't budge.  

I live with the fear that the shapes would all stare  

And grimace or silently judge.

&nbsp; &nbsp; One day I'm just fine, but another I'm not.  

&nbsp; &nbsp; My mind is inflamed; it aches shot after shot.  

A circular square can't belong anywhere,  

When its self-esteem turns to sludge.  

&nbsp;

I'm truly a circle but look like a square.  

My friends all converse through my phone.  

Although my support is dispersed 
everywhere,  

I feel I'm completely alone.

&nbsp; &nbsp; To laugh at my face, “You're just nonsense newfangled!”,  

&nbsp; &nbsp; The powers that be say I'm legally angled.  

“If only I knew this,” I grudge in my prayer,  

“Much sooner,” as I curse my bones.  

&nbsp;

I live in a world full of circles and squares—  

A world where it's so hard to care.

ones I was certain I’d never lose.  
The old ones, the mundane ones, tucked away,  
sitting idle in the drawers of my brain  
next to used batteries  
and forgotten acquaintances’ names.  
&nbsp;

I search everywhere in my vacant house,   
for some hidden conversation, perhaps  
wedged between sofa cushions,   
or flattened under the cutlery tray;  
I search everywhere for any old souvenir,  
any trace of a syllable left by you.  
&nbsp;

But every little piece I pick up,  
every remnant I find nestled away  
is old and withered, like a chip of cinder,  
that disintegrates when touched; and  
these ashes that mountain up at my feet  
remind me of nothing.  
&nbsp;

So I leave you hidden, in your perfect form  
tucked away in those secret drawers.

but I am more than just a wilting flower

These are strange and heavy moments of clarity

sterile room,

with machines whirring and beeping and

hands clutching hands in final moments

How often I forget to revel in the beauty

The older boys split off and built a lean-to,  
gathering pine needles for beds    
and starting a small but confident fire,  
which they guarded jealously.

As the night greened and bled  
toward the horizon, we younger ones  
began searching for shelter, because  
none of us could start a flame.

I had a small pack on my hip  
with a ration of chocolate and a  
silver emergency blanket, which I offered  
in exchange for his company.  
&nbsp;  
He accepted, and we wedged  
ourselves into a small crack in the rock-face  
and begrudgingly huddled for warmth.  
I imagined what it might feel like  
&nbsp;  
if he were to fold my body into his   
much larger one, to be beneath rough  
hands, calloused from tying lanyards  
and building pine-wood derby cars  
&nbsp;   
along my slender fingers, wrists, arms, neck.  
What it might be, here in the cleft of the rock  
to be held, and not for warmth. I shivered  
and pretended it was from the cold.

Of the salt among the beads

Of dead lovers white in sand

There are many playing tag

They chase, flapping in the skies 

Spar and glide above my hair

Theres a silent tango of wings 

That wakes the melancholic romance

Of the waves and the breeze

Invitation to the unfortunate lovers game

And I'm burnt of the sea

That throws me along the bed

Upon which it breaks

Yet tries again to stand 

And like the sea I take

My first steps

Impressions adorning its coasts

And it thrusts itself upon them

A cruelty as it lunges 

As if history shall remember us both

Head first in the sand 

Dragged across shore

If I could swim 

I would walk up to the sea

And hold her up

But like a shy girl 

She'll hold her ruffles and recoil 

Far from me

And if I dare venture close

To her buzz and roars

She'll dare upon me her weight

And like all meek and unmighty men

Shall I too succumb 

Under her massive thunder 

And go along till she beats me

Back to the dust I'm from

They did.

&#x200B;

Evan makes things up.

&#x200B;

He pretends he doesn’t frown when his friend gets a job there.

But he does.

He pretends he didn’t cry when he realized he’d never work there.

But he did.

He pretends he isn’t happy that his dad’s new job is anywhere but there.

But he is.

He pretends that he blames himself for what happened there.

But he doesn’t, not really.

&#x200B;

Evan makes things up.

&#x200B;

He acts like one day he’ll still own the coffee shop where he grew up.

I know he won’t.

He acts like he’ll understand when he’s grown up.

I know he won’t.

He acts like nothing else will ever be this hard.

I know it will.

&#x200B;

Evan knows too.

But it’s okay

Evan makes things up.

And that’s okay too.

Maybe.

464|Solitary (first poem ever)|"Tired, weary and torn

Right down to the bone, 

Tears tumble down and down 

Feeling forever alone. 



Grey skies fill, rain falls

Brown eyes, full lips and lies 

Tall tales he spins

Weaving a clever disguise 



Shadows seep, smudge and creep

Through cracks and gaps

In every corner of the room 

They take hold, squeeze.. collapse 



Can’t wake until the nightmare ends

Must walk and talk and live

For until you come out the other side 

You’ll always be times captive

465|Taste the Love|"I drink pineapple juice to make it taste better

And i use the sweetness to sign my love letter

Written on your belly, marking my place

With some on your thighs and some on your face

Look in my eyes and open your mouth

Sweetness all over you, my hands go down south

To play the instrument with the most beautiful sound

When i use with my fingers you're heavenbound

467|It is catching up.|"

This is my first post on here, I honestly just want as much feedback as possible to help me get better. 

Dance at the periphery  
Tiptoe at the edge  
Gnashing and wailing  
Running out of ground  
The fire has nothing left to consume  
The world has nothing left to give  
Echoes of regret rip through the air  
Screeching, crying, pleading  
Hammering at your ears as they draw a path from now till then  
You cannot turn back  
The cessation of your work fills your eyes  
Embrace it, you have nowhere else to go  
It fills your lungs and covers your skin  
The cloud of ignorance clears from your vision  
It was always coming  
Join at last with yourself  
To destroy one more

468|First Time Musing|"oh hello  
don’t mind me  
i’m just   
here   
going through some good old fashioned   
teenage heartache   
not heartbreak  
no, i haven’t the confidence to   
do anything about it  
it’s just   
an ache   


an ache for her, and for all she is   
and was   
and will be   
she smiles and   
butterflies dance with fireflies   
in my heart   
each word she says   
is etched upon my skin   
for me to examine later in my dreams   


she is the woman that   
makes cheesy top 100 love songs   
feel like shakespeare   
because i finally understand the feelings   
everyone talks about   
“that electric moment”   
“your heart beats faster”   
“you feel alive”   
and i never understood   
because it was never the right person   
until   
her   


oh hello   
don’t mind me  
i just hope that   
one day   
one of us will work up the courage   
to say something   
to the other  


i long for the night   
that one special night   
not sex or kisses or anything so physical   
but words   
the real raw shit   
i mean  
the night that always happens   
at least once   
in a teenage relationship   
where the lateness of the clock   
falls on deaf ears   
where secrets and promises and tears   
fall on keyboards and bedsheets   
and on souls who know too little   
but feel too much  
who need sleep   
but don't care  
who always want more  


at the end of the day  
i’m just a boy   
who knows only what his heart says   
and not why or what to do about it   
and all i can do   
is hope she sees me   
as i see her   


at the end of the day   
im just a boy   
looking at the sky   
and finding deep truths   
in the clouds and rain   
with sad piano music   
drifting into my brain   
and hoping that maybe  
just maybe   
i have a chance at love

470|Finding God in Adobo|"I break my bread,

And dip the starched flesh in adobo.

Today is Sunday,

Eucharist is served.

Some blessed, ethereal thing.

I'm not quite sure,

But I feel moved.

&#x200B;

I think I've heard that

Pork is sinful in the Bible.

In some scripture, surely.

So what meaning should I make of its presence before me?

&#x200B;

It splits apart like fatty lumber.

It's stringy like a sacred harp.

We're all, in our respective pews, sopping it up like a sponge,

Absorbing the labor and pleasure that went into it,

Preaching our hopes and despairs across the Picantería parish-

The World Cup chorus rejoicing on cable TV.

&#x200B;

A poem won't create a sense of community

simply because one wills it to,

But it does present the choice to feel that way,

if so desired.

&#x200B;

God's work is not reaching out and touching my shoulders-

It's Him making this dish possible,

For me to enjoy and ponder something greater.

&#x200B;

To accept that I can't go back in time,

To cherish this lazy afternoon,

To claim this moment like the trips to Sunday School

I would take as a kid,

Impatiently waiting for Oreos and fruit punch 

at the end of the long, holy tunnel,

Completely and utterly missing the point,

Only to make a connection between that experience twenty years ago

and my adobo now.

&#x200B;

Spicy like the sharp moments of life,

Thick like the heavy fog of human experience,

Rich with onions, 

Who have many layers to peel 

before they reveal their true selves

(and you'll cry bearing witness to it, too).

&#x200B;

Of all relationships I could deem have failed me,

Or occasions I didn't rise to.

Experiences that either didn't stretch wildly enough,

Or perhaps had overstayed their welcome on my empirical porch.

For all the material possessions one could gather,

Compared to those whose hands were stripped of them long ago-

Is it possible an ordinary soup could save us?

&#x200B;

Alas, I finish and suck the marrow dry.

Wondering how I could be this full, 

And yet, feel as though tasting God will never be enough.

&#x200B;

473|For my brother|"By the time

We were old enough to know better,

That town's biases had already taken root in our stomachs

Sprouting ugly branches and withered flowers

That needed constant pruning

To keep ourselves from becoming part of that dying garden. 

&nbsp;                      

By the time 

You were confident enough to be yourself

You were already an adult

Living far away from that town,

This country,

And me.

Dad still struggles with it, and I'm sad for him.

He can't see how beautifully,

Wildly,

Desperately

You have bloomed.

In this sea of mediocrity.

On the wings of opportunity i flew,

But after a mistake i did not think through

The jealous rays of the sun, scornfull of my pride,

Melted my wings, hoping i would fall to the ground.

Yet death’s restfull bliss

Evaded me, the Earth i missed.

Rather, i’m now stuck like this,

As if my fame did never exist.

Suffocated by everyday life,

Yearning, allways yearning for the sky.

    for the midnight sky is marred

    electric fire, neon charged.

    I, the watcher, here bear witness

The same velvet sky.  


The sun climbs to take its place on high and  
I long to see it reflected in your  
Midnight eyes, pulling me in like   
The moon draws the tide.

487|An Oddness Of Being|"      ""An Oddness Of Being""   

        These days 
          there seems to be,
          an overpowering
          oddness of being
          overtaking me.
     
        And life, 
          this life, 
          from its turbid view,
          through blemished glass -
    
        It seems as if life 
          is traveling past
          unbelievably slow, 
          so unbearably fast.
    
        And time, 
          our time,
          seems little more 
          than a shifting shape
          in swirling smoke. 
        
        Yesterday, like a faded memory.
        Last year, like the other day.
        Now, like forever.
        Tomorrow, like today. 
        
        Nights, 
          have lost their glow.
        
        Days,
          now fade to black.
        
        And this, 
          my untethered existence, 
             drifts on, 
                 at a snail's pace, 
                       on a swallow's back.

I fall apart

“I’m sorry. I’m sorry. I’m sorry.”  
because I’m such a disappointment

Do you show empathy for others?


Have you been having a hard time

Waking up?

Does it sometimes feel

Like you are brain-stuck,

vaporous

Rapidly expanding

Pushing out the indents in your skull?

Is your head occasionally

Plotting against you?

Do you suddenly want to

Kill yourself at

Three in the morning?

Where do you go

When you get stir-

crazy?

How many cigarettes are you 

Smoking

To numb the buzzing behind

Your eyes?

Who are you letting

Fuck you until you bruise?

When was the last time

You called home?

*

Now,

pick the romance movie

that best describes

You.

492|Dear Friend|"So this is the first poem I've ever written and I decided I might as well post it for some feedback on a brand new account and improve my admittedly questionable poetry skills:

Dear Friend

It's been a while

A break

From the obsidian streaks

Of all but life.

The smears and the stains of

Irremovable darkness which

Festers with every ounce of

Pain and suffering. 

Building like Lego bricks

Up

Up

Up 

Into the sky. 

The height is breathtaking

Balance precarious

The fall fatal

The thin air circled our heads with 

Neon signs and warnings strung 

As fairy lights across our throne

Yet we still managed to fall

                                             Down

                                             Down

                                             Down


Dear Friend

It just goes

On 

And 

On

To the next page

The next chapter

Right until the goddamn epilogue

Where ink is splattered on

Shattered shards

Their blunt edges grazing

Slicing

Contaminating

No regret

Right until I'm left for dea-



Dear Friend

You once engulfed me

Your hand wrapping mine

A never ending hold

Twisting into a choke

As cracks widened

Claws ripping straight

Down through us

Like brittle tissue, 

Tearing into nothingness. 

Leaving me gnarled and burnt, 

Bloody and bruised as you 

Floated far, far away



Dear Friend 

Is it nice up there? 

Watching

Sniggering

As I buckle beneath

The noir falls to

Pull tug scratch

Kick and scream against the sheaths

Leaving nothing 

But whispers across the dirty pale

Resorting to tearing

With stained teeth. 

The persistent muffled scream

Screeches for help

Echoing in an empty chamber

As I melt

Sinking into the rushing stream

A dull tarnished statue



Dont worry, dear friend

I'll soon be joining you

\*\*\*\*\*update: adding in my feedback links at the bottom as I get them completed.

&#x200B;

 

***Hen Song***

Blue Tupperware pitcher scoops up grainy feed.  
I open the door; the wind steals my breath.  
Stepping onto the deck I am stunned  
By the sudden impulse to close my eyes  
Suck in the wind and hear…  
I hear the ocean.  
I can almost see gulls, ring-billed, Bonaparte’s  
Lifting, gliding, tucking, diving  
Snatching up a silver flapping gift  
From the sea.

I crunch through leaves, dried  
Desperate for Spring  
Buttercups plunging toward sky  
Open, thirsty mouths of yellow and white.  
The chickens march, two-footed and beak  
pacing the fence  
Craning their feathered necks  
to see what I have brought.

I scatter and pour,  
Check waterers, collect eggs  
Silkies pecking at the polish on my toes.  
Hello Miracle and Junebug!  
Freedom and Merlin, Icy and Sprinkle!  
Good morning! Good morning!  
Squawk and song applaud a hen’s efforts  
As I retreat, scraping my flip flops in grass.  
I close my eyes and think of echinoderms  
Suspended in the sand.   
A conch shouts my name.

496|On Wonder|"Magic is not real.  
And dragons do not fly.  
Giants do not roam the earth.  
I say it with a sigh.

  
Our heroes don’t have powers,  
And rarely save the day,  
But our villains don’t take over   
The world anyway.

  
Our carpets cannot levitate,  
Nor can our broomsticks zoom.  
Which causes me to cogitate:  
What can we really do?  


If aliens won’t talk to us,  
And genies don’t abound,  
Is there really anything  
More crazy than it sounds?  


Where went the preposterous?  
That wild, unchecked wonder?  
The stories that would foster us,  
Have they been torn asunder?  


Where went our world’s spark?  
And why is there no flame?  
And why upon inspection,  
Does it all look the same?  


Why is there no magic?  
Why don't dragons fly?  
Why can't giants roam the earth?  
I just wish I knew why.  


So if there are no sea monsters,  
What’s left for me to draw  
In empty spaces on the map  
Of lands I never saw?  


And how can I ever look up  
And see the twinkling stars  
And not feel so wistful for  
Something that was once ours?  


And how can I not strive  
To bring back what was lost  
Restore the wonder once again  
Whatever the cost.  


I wish there was magic.  
I wish dragons flew.  
I wish giants roamed the earth,  
And made my wonder true.

The leaves

Of autumn fall

Slowly in and around my hammock,

Blanketing me

In their crisp colors

Of orange, red, and gold.

A bird in the distance

Seems to call my name

As you once did, many years ago.

Before me lies a pond

Perfectly mirroring your image

Only to shatter at the slightest ripple.

With crisp colors of

Orange,

The Perseids


As I sit and watch the sky      
awaiting my night vision to fully adjust,    
the lectures begin in my head.       


There!           
Single finger to the stars:           
The Big Dipper, Ursa Major, the big bear,    
the consummate constellation    
to wow any fresh stargazer     
yearning to chart the expanse for themselves      
and give some organization to their universe.      


But I've seen those falling stars before.    
Years trailing back to the radiant,    
my individual wonder for them has waned.       
I hesitate to measure the angles.    
Where shines curiosity when all distances lie marked         
and all directions catalogued?       


A rock cascading through the atmosphere            
Is assaulted by air molecules to create      
the blazing cape it wears for a brief moment       
before casting off to the horizon       
and the show ends.      


I'm only out here in the mystical moist night air,      
because your wonder is waxing       
and should be magnified,       
drawn into focus.       
In this passing of knowledge,      
my negative capability can be renewed.     
It can perch back along behind Perseus    
and avoid being hardened by the gorgons of the world,        
at least for a little while.        


Your face illuminated by the dim night     
blinds my thoughts    
like the life of those ancient stones      
dashing toward obliteration       
with no care for the sharp fade lingering on the eye.

499|Corpuscular|"Beyond the porch, upon horizon’s rim,  
A gauze of gumtrees: rusted cloudforms   
Unfolding on hillsides. Thin branches twist  
Like wisps of smoke and dissipate  
Into a sky aglow with layered hues  
Of peach and pale-lavender.  
The colours in the foreground brushed with ink,  
With silhouettes of palm fronds afloat  
In slow currents of air. Soon, the serene  
Perspective melts, as near and far  
Combine alchemically to loose  
A memory within me that swells  
Out, merges with the scenery:  
A tropical anatopism pouring from  
My soul and writing over all  
The outback’s haphazard scrawl.  
  
&nbsp;
  
I feel the world’s unending breadth extend    
On lengths of my being. My fingers stretch and curl  
And palplike shadows scrape up parts   
Of landscape, leaving plump furrows.  
My mind’s eye goes further, follows  
The undulations beyond memory’s flow,  
Descending through remotely metred eons,  
Until at last some deeper part of me,  
An ancestor maybe, stands upon     
A desert expanse, an arid triassic   
Land rolling down and folding within  
A forest’s embrace. My heartbeats pump  
A lifeblood through the roots and veins  
Of the vista. My inner-ear attunes  
And hears a thunderous thump of a clawed  
T-Rex paw throbbing through    
The world. It stomps,   
In stuttered steps,    
Approaches, slows:   
Footfalls     
Of pulse."

501|We Walked As One|"We walked as one through antique land,

Down streets of cobblestone,

And felt, whilst strolling hand in hand,

We’d never be alone.

&#x200B;

But ambling there, without a care,

My blood began to chill,

And rounding corners with despair,

I spoke at once, all shrill:

&#x200B;

“Let’s leave, my dear, let’s turn away,

Cast off these troubled trails!”

She’d seen, I saw with full dismay,

A sign advising ‘Sales’.

&#x200B;

“My love, we simply MUST, you see

Your sleeves, they’re all askew,”

She carried on with naked glee,

“And what about your shoes!”

&#x200B;

“You’ve barely bought a stitch this year,”

She lied behind her smile,

“Let’s hurry now, to the cashier!”

She shoved me down the aisles.

&#x200B;

“But dear”, I spluttered, full of dread,

“We mustn’t pause our plans,

We’ve booked and paid and called ahead!”

She grasped my clammy hands.

&#x200B;

“My love, you really mustn’t fret,

It simply will not do,”

She added, with a touch of threat,

“Let’s see about those shoes.”

&#x200B;

“Those soulless soles will have to go,

The lace is one big knot!

The leathered holes reveal your toes,

The aglets agle not!”

&#x200B;

“And whilst we’re there, your fleece is floss,

Your jumpers seldom jump,

For when you dress, it’s mainly dross,

The ties are one big lump!”

&#x200B;

“Your slippers slip, your zippers wilt,

Those briefs are now a thong,

I’d rather die than see your kilt

Combined with that sarong.”

&#x200B;

“Your scarf? A laugh. That vest? A jest.

Overalls are over,

All in all, we’ve just one quest:

To dress you like you’re sober!”

&#x200B;

And so I had to acquiesce,

To save me from her tears,

Depressed to dress, and in distress,

We’ve been in here for years.

Spigot Ray in Detroit City, come on home, come on home.

Speed King, Bucky Two, Elly Mae on LSD,

We haven't kept the kind of touch I meant to keep.

You all are hanging out like ghosts tonight

Apparitions in the middle of my middle-class white lawn

Like children up to mischief in the schoolyard sharing wine,

Your same old selves, together again.

I didn't mean to leave you.

And catch them like we used to,

And this time try them on.

From me here at this drowsy proverbial bar

And she’s elegant, saucy, like high class spaghetti,

Her soft lips are glossy, but mine aren’t yet ready

To open ‘cause talking could burst her nice bubble,

My signals are squawking while hers are more subtle

And who knows? They could be not signals at all

Cause she’s prob’ly just here to sit sipping her tall

Gin and tonic and wanting that no brazen creep

Be so crazy to think he’d her company keep

Yet I can’t help but hope that by some stroke of fate

I could trip into contexts where we conversate,

But I don’t, and like clockwork some dude then appears

And she turns to him, smiles, like she’d waited for years

For some soul in the room to engage her in talkin’.

I leave, having erred on the wrong side of caution.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a verbal comma)  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a romance unspoken   
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;an unbroken vase.   
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A pause before the show,

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;pulse of daylight.   
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One heartbeat   
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;one thrum

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WILL RHYME FOR FOOD   
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But no one reads signs anymore   
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So instead he recites senryū   
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;out loud to himself in   
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;muted saxophone drones   
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;tones drifting slowly from his body   
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;like islands from a sailboat   
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and they reach the ears of the neighbor girl alone

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She doesn't know what they mean   
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but she likes the way he dreams out loud

&nbsp;Everything's ok here on Chambers Street.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The traffic lights   
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;sigh in cycle  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Police cars

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The priests laugh for the cameras and   
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another man died last night   
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;on this street-corner.   
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(frostbite   
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but no one noticed, so that's alright.)   
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and the smell wasn't too hard to ignore.   
&nbsp;The next evening,   
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the carpenters and the plumbers   
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;told stories about it to one another   
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in beatbox beauty.   
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beating their chests and besting death   
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;with bullets from a tongue   
&nbsp;But everyone goes home to their Victrola at ten   
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and back next week to duel again  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are many nice movies and plays to see   
&nbsp;&nbsp;Here on Chambers Street.   
&nbsp;   
&nbsp;There's baggage to sell on Chambers Street.   
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A simple thought:   
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a war unfought – for now.   
&nbsp;Cautiously, she wanders in.   
&nbsp;""Hi mom, I'm home.""   
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A face like tallow   
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;too tall, and too narrow   
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;frail like bones without marrow   
&nbsp;And she carries with her   
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a story to tell

Please enjoy these excerpted poems. Review them if you'd like to. All 10 of them will be included in the book, along with many many more. (The entire collection is 57 pages long, and represents over 10 years of work.) I hope you will consider purchasing a copy on Amazon or at your favorite brick-and-mortar book store. I'm told the price point will be under $10, so it should be very reasonable. 


Thank you, OCPoetry, for coming with me on this incredible journey, and for supporting me and my work. I couldn't have done any of this without you.

506|My earliest memory|"Soft yellow lamplight lit my mother's face.

She sat in an armchair, silent tears streaming down.

I sat in her lap and handed her a tissue.

--

Later, I knew.

My sister came too soon.

Her tiny hand

Her tiny heart

The beat of it upon my mother's breast.

Forty-five minutes of breath.

A life cut short on a Thanksgiving in Minnesota.

507|Let's build a blanket fort|"Let's build a blanket fort today.

We'll crawl inside to laugh and play.

When we're inside we’ll play pretend

and hope our fun will never end.

--

Can we pretend we're astronauts?

Our spaceship has some polka dots.

Side by side or face to face,

we'll float up into outerspace.

--

Or maybe it's a time machine.

We'll visit an old English queen.

She'll say “Good day,” and “How are you?”

and make us knights of England too.

--

Or will it be a circus tent

where tigers are the main event?

Acrobatic stunts will thrill.

The crowds will never get their fill.

--

It doesn't matter what we play

so long as we can play all day.

Come play with me.  We'll play pretend.

Hey look, our fort is done my friend!

    spindled fins flailing
    in the mirror failing

518|A Fucking Poem [NSFW]|"
A gentle kiss, a playful tease  
Tearing clothes off with urgent ease  
I bite my lip, fall to my knees  
Overcome with the urge to please  

Soft lips move south  
Hard dick, warm mouth  
Small moan, firm suck  
Hey babe, let's fuck  

Our tangled bodies, pussy, wang  
Fit together like yin and yang  
Push it deeper, I like it rough  
There's no such thing as close enough  

You thrust, I ride  
Up, down, side to side  
Eyes close, hearts race  
Short breaths, fast pace  

Pressure building, my toes curling  
The thoughts in my head start whirling  
Your lips, your dick, it's like a dream  
I can't help it if I start to scream  

Muscles tight, ready to explode  
I cum so hard, you blow your load,  
The grand finale, the feast of feasts  
We lay panting underneath the sheets.  
How to describe, perfect, sublime?  
How bout damn, can't wait til next time!

522|cocaine|"
There were two kids doing lines   
off the marble kitchen counter;  
the fine powdered sugar leaving  
red pimples on their philtrums.   

&nbsp;

They wore identical red hoodies and   
they were both brunette with green eyes.  
they had scars on their bottom left cheeks.   
I heard them sobbing in the bathroom,  

&nbsp;

they were holding each other like how children  
hold puppies; the joy was almost eerie in their   
cries for help.   
Maybe it was the cocaine.   

&nbsp;


I was draped over some blonde girl   
whose name started with an A and   
who went to some school in the general vicinity  
and she told me right before i picked her up  
and wrapped her legs around me  

&nbsp;

that she hadn’t seen the new Star Wars and   
it made her feel isolated.   

&nbsp;

You smoked weed with your boyfriend  
out by the pool and you felt so far away  
and even though your lips were an inch away  
from his, your hand was on my face and the  
moon licked the darkness underneath your eyelids.   


&nbsp;

the music shook the house with each beat  
and vases filled with ashes of relatives long gone  
stumbled and shattered  
 like they were made of styrofoam. 

&nbsp;

I sat alone in the master bedroom  
surrounded by everything I could possibly remember,   
dating all the way back to skinning my knee back   
when I was four  
and the world crumbled before my eyes.

who could begrudge you this cigarette, when it used to make you look so boldly overexposed, so sunglasses-long-hair cool?

526|[LSD Sessions] So Went the Fox and I|"One day I met upon my way  
A lovely fox who pranced and played,  
In quiet awe I ceased my stride   
She stopped as well but did not hide,  
Her eyes I held and hers did mine;  
So saw the fox and I.  
 
&nbsp;

I dared not move, I kept quite still  
And so it was with no small thrill,  
She neared to me, arm’s length or less  
And did not run from my caress,  
Yet she still trembled at my touch;  
So met the fox and I.  
 
&nbsp;

Our bond thus made she led me now  
I watched her play intrigued at how,  
In little things she took delight  
Like flowers, trees and other sights,  
She taught me much about the world;  
So walked the fox and I.  
 
&nbsp;

As we progressed along the path  
My stoic self began to laugh,  
To watch how charming, how carefree  
That lovely creature could now be,  
It moved me deep within in my breast;  
So went the fox and I.  
 
&nbsp;

Such simple splendour we then felt  
As boy and fox on hilltop knelt  
And watched the world for some short while  
Repose devoid of care nor trial  
A quiet place where time stood still;  
So knelt the fox and I.  
 
&nbsp;

When came the time to leave again  
I bade the lovely fox remain,   
For my path led through the unknown  
A journey safest made alone,  
I could not bear her come to harm;  
So stood the fox and I.  
 
&nbsp;

""I promise, fox, you'll walk with me.  
For in our time I came to see  
That kindred souls will 'oft ensure  
Their paths will intertwine once more  
It won't be long I promise dear.""  
So loved the fox and I.

Do you ever write poetry that is so deeply intertwined with personal emotional experience that you really don't care if anyone else in the world gets it? This is one of those. 

&nbsp;

Backstory: I spent years taking LSD and other psychedelics and writing under the influence, more as an experiment than anything else. I have no interest in publishing and loathe the idea of blogging, so I finally swallowed enough courage to share some of the collection here on Reddit because...why the hell not? I have modified my disclaimer from the other submissions from ""It's probably shit."" to ""It's all bullshit"". I think that more aptly describes my position on my work.

528|Someday I'll Tell You A Funny Story|"Someday I'll tell you a funny story

About how getting lost with you one afternoon made me feel like I was exactly where I needed to be

That when you held me and eased my childish fears after a long night of drinking, it felt like love

And when I woke to find you asleep a full 12 inches away, I wished it was a different kind of love

&nbsp;

Someday, I'll talk in detail

Of how, for a while, you were my home

I'll let you in on how the thought of spending the rest of my life with you seemed—for a moment—blissful

I'll make you understand that when you kissed me behind my ear and we said our goodbyes, I felt a lump in my throat and the beginnings of a chronic homesickness

&nbsp;

Someday is not today, tomorrow, or the day after that

Someday, should it exist, is when we have settled comfortably into our lives and our arms are home to different people

When there are too many things standing in the way of us acting on our whims

When declarations of former non-platonic love can do no harm

&nbsp;

Someday, we will sit intimately as old friends do

Exchange pleasantries and engage in a little playful arguing as we have always done

And when I'm sure all other stories have been told, I will ask you if you have time for one more

    Finally told you how I felt and though I thought that I'd get better  
    I cannot seem to calm the tides that crash so violent on the sides of my mind  


    Set sail for endless nights,
    Sit still but tremble on. As the night leads way to dawn.  



    I cannot bear the thought of breaking,
    Losing hope I grab the rope but now my hands wont stop their shaking.    


    And though I tie and hope to die, I will hang on until you're gone.
    I will wait patient for the dawn, the mast has fallen through the deck, the water rises to my neck.    


    And it comes back and through and over you, the feeling of despair.
    I try to plead with you and breathe for you but gasp I do for air  


    And right before I really lose it
    Before I come undone  


    I beg the sky and moon and trees that soon my death may swiftly come    

    Oh how you've snared me with your vines I cannot flee thee
    Let me go, I ask; Oh darling wont you free me?  


    I cannot live without your love so looking down and then above
    The waves they crash and roar and shove  


    I spot an exit on the deck,
    I wrap it tightly 'round my neck  


    I've carried on and now your gone
    I waited patient for the dawn  

    I tie the noose as I lose hope
    Still hanging on, but by a rope

530|For You|"Late into the night


When moonlight filters through my curtains


and my eyes are at half-mast


and my body is limp with approaching sleep


I still feel her hand caressing my hair


And her breath a soft whisper on my cheek


And I almost forget that she’s an illusion


I almost forget the phone call


That shoved a fist in my throat


And made me feel like I was attempting to swallow oceans


The voice that felt like medicinal syrup in my ears


“She’s gone.”


As my body becomes cymbals crashing to the floor


Waves crashing into rocks


Action disintegrating into reaction.


“She’s gone.”


And I wake


With my hair in disarray


Not from hands but from tossing and turning.


Goosebumps encapsulating my flesh


Not from her touch but cool air coming through my open window.




And I remember


The only constant in life is change.

But then I wake up

Not here.

532|In Love with The Coffeeshop Girl|"Every morning I order a double americano  
(So refined!)    
and a fresh pastry,   
(How continental!)  
and write poems about The Coffeeshop Girl.  
(He's probably writing a novel...) 

The Coffeeshop Girl and I are in love but we're both too shy to admit it.  
We tell each other in subtle ways.

I say things like ""Good Morning,"" I smile. I leave a tip.    
She says things like 
""the usual?"" and
""Have a nice day!"".   

I sit by the window behind a notebook and thick frames.
Another notebook with thick frames sits at the counter,
more thick frames with laptops sit at tables.

They say things like ""Good Morning,"" they smile. They leave a tip.  
She says things like ""the usual?"" and ""Have a nice day!"".

We all order double americanos.   
(So predictable!)    
We all eat the fresh pastries.   
(How cliché!)    
We write all poems about The Coffeeshop Girl.  
(He's probably just like the rest...)  

We're all in love

533|People as Teeth|"I’ve built cemeteries on skyscrapers    
using only grave mistakes,    
and the knowledge that if I fell    
I’ll be returned straight to the scenes of    
crimes I’ve implicated myself in.    


I stopped long enough to hear somebody    
compare people to teeth, and I begged    
internally    
to be considered a maxillary canine.    
I don’t have the roots.    


The streets glistened with dew-covered    
people, singing what they thought.    
Everybody had a map in their pocket,    
they ran their fingers along in the creases    
and found distinctions in the dark.    


I lost my co-ordinates years ago.


All I ever wanted was candles on a birthday cake.


I am not a great man.    
I am not great."
534|Seagull (Length warning)|"    Endless beach, an endless coast,
    along the bleak gray sea.
    Not one person who would see me,
    I walk, head bowed, a lonely ghost.
    I went off the way, now I'm lost,
    My face a mask yet still I scream.
    
    The seagulls sing to me of loss.
    Of time thrown away,
    of years murdered for fun and sport.
    Yet they don't see,
    that I see,
    their piece of bread
    as full of rot.
    Each has their own,
    each is rotten,
    for even overeating seagulls,
    further along the coast,
    will be forgotten,
    their corpses resting
    under the lonely dune,
    most free of maggots,
    quickly rotting,
    but dug out, allowed to return,
    when great eagle, ever cruel
    needs victims
    noble heroes
    wicked villains
    forgotten names 
    and seagulls must dance to his tune. 
    I wish, believe, and hope
    to not be another corpse
    to fly free, to brave
    the winds further
    along the coast
    or at least to dig
    my own grave.
    
    Now I can see,
    having my own Sun
    I have the beak and the feathers
    the hollow bones and small,
    smooth brain
    like my fellow seagulls,
    no matter how much more I crave.
    I hate them
    wish them pain
    and loss and death
    for I cannot stand and stare
    at them, and see
    the beaks, the feathers we share.
    And still, I wish
    to see them all glow
    not fall down, into the dark.
    A shattered mind,
    standing in the middle
    craving every road at once
    tearing his flesh
    loving the pain
    the war,the peace
    the ice, the fire
    the men, the women.
    I land once again.
    
    Heavy rain breaking my wings,
    I hop forward,
    maybe they will heal,
    under the gentle light
    that stings,
    my sight, that burns so much,
    slowly melting
    the frost,
    the iron cage
    I built with pride,
    for myself,
    around my heart.
    Its useless now.
    There was ever only ice,
    and the beach is warm,
    burning, even though the heat
    makes more birds sit down
    and freeze
    with silver grains of sadness
    swallowing their feet.
    It tires me yet more
    to see them fall.
    I am after all,
    just another little seagull,
    fragile
    and scared of the dark.
    
    Yet I should stay here,
    I think, with the Sun
    finally shining through clouds
    to drink the warmth,
    to feel the pain
    of light in my eyes.
    And laugh
    into the face of the storm,
    for the eagle doesn't know,
    one day I will fly again.

And I'm crazy

Thinking of nothing

Only about her


Where ever I look

I only see that face

Looking back at me

One I want to embrace


I can do nothing

Can't fight that feeling

I am hopeless

Not worth concealing


I am in love

And I hate it

I want to live like this

Yet I want to stop it


I want to be with her

But I don't want to force it

With my heart I love her

And nothing to endorse it


I am in love

Again it seems

Lost in feelings

The girl of my dreams

Her lips tighter than her white knuckles on the helm.

Sunk shut because I opened mine

it was send her away.

And I know when my ship sails back,

She won't be on it.

All covered in scars, tear running like mascara.

life has seeped into stillness.

The chair ponders.

The ceiling fan with a gaze like God's.

There are wars being fought,

and lands being conquered:

the starving termites pound 

at the creaking wood with rusty teeth.

&nbsp;

A melancholy song pours:

pattering tapwater blends

into the whiteness of the sink.

The cold, unforgiving clock ticking.

There's a world outside,

and one in closed spaces:

I called in sick again.

It's not as if I'm sitting in despair.

I'm liable to stare at the TV

and can't be bothered to get off the chair.


--

My vision blurs and everything feels gray.

One could say that I'm a royal bum.

Exactly what I feel is hard to say.

All that comes to mind is the word “numb”.

--

All the dishes languish in the sink.

The laundry isn't done for days on end.

Every thought is difficult to think.

My only consolation--my best friend.

--

The worst days are the ones I sleep for hours--

Disconnected from my family.

I won't get up to even take a shower

and everything is meaningless to me.

--

Rarely I’ll be waiting for a train 

and think of how I'd really like to jump.

So far, at least, I’ve talked back to my brain

and mostly what I am is just a grump.

--

I'm writing this to simply let you know

not everyone's depression looks the same.

I'm hopeful now to see awareness grow.

For anyone who suffers, have no shame.

A prisoner of warmth. 


Trapped in this cell of anxiety. 


With a blind warden. 


One who cannot see the prisoner. 


Yet talks to the god as if it is nothing 




Your golden hair that flows and curls. 


The demeanor that rips sympathy from me. 


Your unprecedented kindness. 


It all brings my heart to a still. 


And my mind at ease




Is it love?  


A simple admiration of beauty?  


I do not know. 


I simply feel like I’m drowning. 


Drowning in this silence. 


Drowning in my fear




In this dark void. 


That i float in despair. 


You are my beacon. 


My hope. 


My brilliant star that i wish to pluck. 


The star that i love.

It’s weird to think someone could come to the conclusion that the best option, or a viable option, would be to kill oneself. 

Two here already kicked the bucket. What did they think?

Why would something of this world, something likely material, or a relationship that has only existed in this small blip of the timeline of the universe, be even worthy enough to make one consider going against millions of years of evolution.

In wind and step it dances when,


Your body rocks from now to then.

Your Combing hand with wedding rings.


But while you weep alone tonight,


Know your beauty, and know your might.

With Skin of mocha, and color fair.


Your eyes of dark like deepest ponds,


Your smile curls as you respond:

""I see you there my fairytale,

My man of honor withstand the hail.

The raining down of crushing doubt,

I promise you won't go without;



 
&nbsp;
My love and joy, these desperate things,


You must know my heart, it sings.


For you my dear it's pushing through,


And pumping love right into you.



 
&nbsp;
So stand you there you golden child,


One of temper so calm and mild.


Faithful when bad times have come,


Staring long with eyes like rum.



 
&nbsp;
A gentle warmth will find you slow,


But there are things that you must know:


Moonlit walks and midnight hours,


Are bricks we used to build our towers.



 
&nbsp;
Now I step into the light,


I find my strength, and find my might.


You speaking soft with baited breath,


Be as strong as you are bereft.""

My flaming girl with voice like rain,


With gentle hands my heart she tamed.


With steady words and careful eyes,


A healing force in me did rise.



 
&nbsp;
To stitch together these woven things,


This tapestry of pain's demise.


My heart would whimper as soon as sing,


For days of future wedding rings.

So wait I here for your return.


My flaming girl a lesson learned,


My patience parts and faith gives rise,


To these words I write: My battle cry.

The cooking chair would be so

A poem to amaze
 
Today I’ll take some paper 

And scribble in a blaze 

Will I write of beauty?

Like what an artist craves 

Or will I write to hurt

559|Introspection|"**I am a pretty introverted individual, and spend a great deal of time in my own head, analyzing everything and rationalizing my feelings. This is sort of what it feels like for me:**

&nbsp;

Introspection, introspection,

Countless thoughts of misdirection.

Neurons firing sans intention.

Focus lost, pay no attention.

&nbsp;


“What you see is what you get,”

But what if I’m not finished yet?

There’s so much more here to inspect.

Come take a look, don’t be suspect.

&nbsp;


My eyes are blind to what I see.

My senses bent from reality.

There is no meaning to conceive.

The darkness lends me no reprieve.

&nbsp;


The words aloft are grasping out.

They crave the touch of one in doubt.

Breaking through the olden grout,

They drag him down, he never shouts.

&nbsp;


Lost in me, he seeks to find.

The damage that was left behind.

Intent on trying to unwind,

The tiny fractures of my mind.

&nbsp;


Yet,

Despite his pure intentions,

There is no chance of intervention.

Well runs dry of comprehension.

That’s the game of introspection.

inside my arms  
like a letter,           
and like an angel        
she carried a divine message.                    
So I pushed the envelope        
and climbed inside her language.  
On that day,  
I parted the clouds                               
and erased their white masses      
with the edges of my thumbs,  
careful not to nudge her    
from the grasps of sleep.      
I wanted to share her beauty  
with the Universe-  
to take her by the hand                          
and up into infinity-                            
to refuge on the outskirts of Pluto,    
and swing on the rings of Saturn.      
So I lifted the glasses  
pulling on her ears  
and folded them in my shirt.      
I picked the litany of freckles    
sprinkled under her eyes  
and across the bridge of her nose  
one by one  
with delicate fingertips,    
and one by one  
I drew them back into the sky  
as stars for all the world to see.    
She did not wake,  
but only shifted her head  
to fit more comfortably    
inside the pocket  
of my celestial shoulder,    
stirring off further  
down the rabbit hole  
of another dream.  
Now wherever I'm without Her,  
whenever I look up into the night,  
I see Her beautiful face  
strewn across a bottomless canvas,  
and I pray beyond a reasonable faith  
She will one day deliver upon me  
this same courtesy-  
reach down inside my weary bones,  
pluck the birthmarks off my arms,    
and legs,    
and torso,    
one by one  
like wilting flowers,  
bend down and kiss away  
the constellation of tears  
welling up inside the corners  
of my tiny smile,    
kidnap me from my tiny corner of the world,  
and drop me onto the arms of spirals,  
into the far corners of the galaxy,  
so I can join Her forever  
in the heavens.

in children's rhymes, in cinder blocks,

and I will love her to my grave.  

I found my love in war's deep scars,  
in circuit boards, in prison bars,  
in sleeping dust and rising smoke -  
my soul answered when my love spoke.  

I found my love in kitten's purr,  
in fox's squeak, in metal's burr,  
in molten glass and depths of space -  
still I see little of her face.  

I found my love in raven's wings,  
in orange embers, in secret things,  
in air's caress and quiet earth -  
the catalysts of my rebirth.  

I found my love in Mimir's well,  
in Avalon, in Dante's Hell,  
in Middle-Earth and Homer's Troy -  
and still, I'm no more than a boy.  

I found my love in blues-note riff,  
in Bloom County, in Spaceman Spiff,  
in beds with legs and mice with bricks -  
again, the needle my thumb pricks.  

I found my love in warm caress,  
in ordered print, in puzzle's mess,  
in lightning bright and thunder loud -  
the more I learn, the more I'm proud.  

I found my love in orchards wide,  
in emerald hearts, in blushing bride,  
in phoenix down and warrens deep -  
that which I know, I dare not keep.  

I found my love in trailers small,  
in graphite shapes, in teacher's call,  
in paper, lined both blue and straight -  
and I rejoice, to pass her gate.

They cup each moment in their hand as if it were a precious crystal. 

Their own personal flurry of melodrama and romance. 



I contemplate the significance behind each of their individual robotic movements. 
Their awkward twist of limbs, choreographed together into a chaotic crescendo. 

I allow myself to indulge and find myself lost in their unfounded passion. 

It rests for a second, sweet on my tongue, but as always I find myself sinking into the black waters of an unending apathy. 


For I myself have never known such boundless love. 

I am not yet educated in the art of seeing the world through rose tinted lenses. 

All and all is all I am.

And this is all that I have to give.

    A hole in the shape of a red-headed woman

Sometimes there are hard times fighting the fleas

Sometimes I lay on out feeling the breeze

Out far in the ocean for land to spare

It's never existing it's never quite there

To find there was nothing to hold onto tight

575|Marijuana Dice|"I started writing this poem when I was in a mental institution doing therapy for schizophrenia induced by marijuana consumption. For those who don't know, schizophrenia has ""negative"" symptoms like low motivation, depression and anxiety. It also has ""positive"" symptoms like delusions, paranoia, visual and auditory hallucinations. Marijuana helps with the negative symptoms, but for individuals susceptible to psychosis it brings along the positive symptoms with it. Hence the consumption of marijuana is likened to gambling on one's fate. I hope you see the resemblance of my story (and maybe your individual stories) in the poem. Looking forward to your feedbacks!

Nothing gives him a push

whether in heaven or hell below.  
Dead-bored, feels no rush,  
no matter high stakes or low.

Through foggy waters dim.

Unknown they were for him.




I praised and kissed the fingertips,

Which danced along the frets.

I held cold hands – so tenderly, 

Not knowing why you wept.




Now someday soon I’ll come to play,

And hold the neck again;

Of black guitar which helped to grow

A love for my once friend.

578|Back In Town for Your Father's Funeral|" If March brings life, then November is the dying time.

Bare skeletons masquerade as trees, and birds sit silent

As grief flaps, wide-winged, to perch across your back.

We share glances like children trading secrets,

Gathered like pagans around a standing stone.

One for sorrow, and us in black—a single shadow.

&#x200B;

A raised hand against the weak sun; your veil—a shadow,

As dirt falls onto polished wood and keeps time.

Words come from you slower than blood from a stone.

My only consolation is this; your arm against mine isn't silent.

Holding hands, hidden by your coat sleeves, your worst kept secrets

Rest on my tongue like wafer, like ash, like things I can't give back.

&#x200B;

Home is a place you left behind, afraid to look back

In case you saw someone at the window; a shadow.

Here's a list of things you can't keep—wishes, secrets,

People, wild birds. They all escape you in time.

The wooden floors went petrified and groaning pipes went silent.

The rooms we walked were cold; our pale, bare feet on stone.

&#x200B;

I'm looking at window panes with hands empty for a stone,

But you turn away, and I come to lay my head on your back.

Arms across your stomach, and your heartbeat isn't silent.

But the early setting sun makes your face a shadow,

And you leave me in the garden to be alone for a time.

Keeping your own council, keeping your own secrets.

&#x200B;

Waiting, I count blackbirds on the powerline; seven for secrets

That we can't even tell ourselves, or Medusa with a mirror, we turn to stone.

Someone told me once, well meaning, ""These things take time.""

I had two choices; I dropped my fist and turned my back.

A bird wings across the sky like a silky shadow.

I make a wish, but keep it on my tongue, sweet and silent.

&#x200B;

The man they laid in the ground today had sat, statue-silent,

When you first grabbed my hand, fierce like you were screaming secrets.

Anger clawed across his face like a shadow

And when he shook his head, he turned your beating heart to stone.

But when we went out the garden gate, like Lot's wife I looked back

With salt across my face, and he had watched us walk away for the longest time.

&#x200B;

Don't let us wait, drawn silent, as we run out of time, 

Each of us refusing to give our secrets back.

Everything we love becomes a shadow when they put us under stone.

580|HYDRANGEA|"She winters her hydrangea in the house –

a gift from all her sons but me.

Three plants jostle for territory

in a single pot. Their woody stems

trace a tortuous helix

while all their leaves lean toward the window

yearning toward the sky, toward the sun

the origin of all Spring

&#x200B;

The other plants are permanent residents

each having staked a claim

on this table or that patch of floor

vigor and rot in equal measure:

living tendrils grasp, entwine like greedy fingers

while dying leaves swoon into heaps, crisp scabs

encroaching, threatening, constraining our footpaths

to an ever-narrowing corridor

where we can no longer avoid one another

on our way from room to room

&#x200B;

These quieter children thank her only by growing

and making a mess of her hardwood floors

which contain memories of their own:

the feet that trod upon them

and a forest—fetid, tropical, home—

far from here and long ago.

They frame the narrow path she walks

between the dead leaves and the living

as we cry for water, water, water

583|O Ye of Little Faith (Revision #1)|"1

But Peter stepped out of the boat  
and sank to the bottom of the Galilean sea  
watching the sun shrivel  
from a pear to a pin prick  
as his breath slowly realized  
it had no where to go  
and cratered back into  
the center of his chest.  
Noah’s flood returned  
to gather the remnants of its harvest  
the organs, the senses, the wickedness  
it had left behind.

But Goliath's shadow  
spanned the field  
as his frame towered above  
and years of hard work in the   
field, son you be an honest man  
you be a good man, you be a   
kind man and the sword tore into  
his shoulder blade and stopped  
at his coronary artery where the   
blood ran out out and the last of David   
was seen as a blood stain on a leaf stomped   
into the hard-packed ground.

But 30 pieces of silver struck inharmoniously  
to the temple floor  
and Satan looked upon an empty noose swaying back   
and forth on the Judas tree. Alone.   
For what a sight to see, Jesus, pacing back and   
forth in the garden, encircled, muttering   
""kiss me, fool.""  
""Kiss me.""  
""Goddamn it, kiss me.""  

He would pace there his whole life  
waiting for the guards to push through  
the crowds, but they never came, Instead, now,   
 an old man staring into a cold fire,   
staring into all the the things he was,     
all the things he could never be.

***(7 days remaining!)***

I keep my names in a little locked box  
With drawers and tags and manilla file cards.  
Little metal keys fit little grey locks   
And little trim slots fit little bent hearts.   

&nbsp;   

I keep my keys in a big sturdy desk   
With four sturdy Hepplewhite iron-tip feet   
And a big sturdy top, on which I rest   
The big sturdy brick made of his deceit.   

&nbsp;   

I keep my desk in an old dusty room   
With dust on the sills under dusty panes   
And dust swirls around in the dusty gloom   
But the dust never settles in the rain,    
In the rain, and the dust never settles   
On the brick, on the table, with the key,   
In the drawer, for the locks, on the boxes   
With the bent little trim hearts arranged.   

&nbsp;   

The dust never settles on my names.

588|Who she is|"The scars of her past

Hidden under her clothes

Are a road map to places

That nobody goes

Her smile is a mask,

She's a master of disguise,

But if you really knew her,

You could see it in her eyes

The tears flow down

And fall off her nose

As she cries in corners

That nobody goes

Her eyes tell a story

Of anger and pain

Her past is a mistake

Her life, Just a stain

589|vice|"when I love  
I love hard;  
harder than necessary.  
I dig my fingernails in,  
wrap my arms tight around my lover,  
try to absorb them into my bones

once  
I loved a girl who was stronger than iron,  
more brittle than glass,  
and sharper than her tongue  
when she finally shattered.

I broke my bones trying to hold onto her

I snapped each and every delicate finger  
as she dragged them away from her skin

that was a lesson to me;  
people break when you hold them too tightly,  
their edges will cut you deeply  
if you refuse to let them go

Darkest nights bring brightest dawns,

So chin up and soldier on!


Alright enough.

I heard you say it,

I know the game I just can’t play it.

The rules are wrong, I’m way behind,

We’re stuck at different starting lines

And my mind can barely find the time

To pull this all together.



Oh okay,

That sounds hard!

Did you try talking to God?

Meditation! Self-affirmations!

Medication! My sister got a service dog!



I know, I know.

I’m getting there.

Fighting the feeling it’s not fair how

3 years ago I didn’t care.

Now all I do is pull my hair,

And clench my teeth,

And squeeze my fists

and scratch my wrists.



Maybe you’re right,

I’ll give it a try 

For what feels like the thousandth time.


That’s the spirit! 

Now say goodnight!

Okay, now turn off the light.


I’ll wake up in the morning,
you’ll still be in my head.
That’s fine with me,
because honestly,
you’re the half that gets me out of bed.

It’s not my place to occupy your heart.

No matter how it hurts

to be outside, to be apart.

Your young and tender years are just

too delicate to spoil with tears.

So much to live, to feel, to see.

Far be it for I to, selfishly,

tempt you to waste your thoughts on me.

And so, from my headstart,

I’ll stand aside, advise, impart.

592|Her, without poetry|"Curves more smooth as cursive but

Moves more powerful than bold font

Fingers too fast for a typewriter

Tongue too skilled for a rapper

Skin more pure than a canvas

Better dressed than a melody

More sincere than a song

Far sexier than a sonnet

More natural than a haiku

Streams of consciousness aren’t as true

More meaningful than a muse

Deeper than some sappy blues

This isn’t a love poem, those fall flat

She is so much more than that

you saw the slight terror in my eyes,


when a fly flew in a five foot radius of my face.


in agony, i began to imagine the larvae it would produce


and the aggression with which it would land on my neck.


it would crawl to my left chest,


and carve a hole where it thought it belonged;


leaving its eggs so it would never be forgotten.


with fear i would stand and wait for what’s next,


but before i knew it the fly was gone.


there wasn’t a hole in my chest,


but i still felt the maggots.


i closed my windows.


i released the insects.


i stay away from you.

Sat slumped, back curled on   
curtain tails.  
Glass stained with  
the pitter patter of  
a night unslept.  
Dew drips from window and down each cheek.



Every week spent  
waiting for that wake-up, glancing at  
eyes dancing in the sunrise.  
Every day spent peering  
at a fish hook, the    
 curl of lips  
cast across her face,   
held tight with bated breath.  
Every minute spent here, by the wall

unravelling thoughts of a life unlived and tying them  
to the rafter.

stone pillars shaped like trees, imaginings.  
The spirits in me quarreled and grew bored.  

In blossom clouds was heaven neatly stored.  
In earth below my feet hellfire licked out  
with tongues, not real tongues, just tongues of flame.  
Soon I'll forget what I was on about.

Soon I will be one more defiant horde  
roving a barren field, yawping my shame,

597|Note|"    At the base of a hill, in a juniper field
    in the cool, breezy shade of a tree
    There's a note that I left, and to help ward off theft,
    No one knows it was written by me.

    Now this note tells a tale so tremendous in scale,
    that it dwarfs anything you could read
    but you could always try, as the days pass you by
    to acquire the skill that you need.

    You deserve a stern warning, however, I'll add
    That the few who have read it have all gone quite mad
    See, this note contains secrets not meant to be known
    by the primitive species who call Earth their home

    Please don't misunderstand what I'm trying to say
    You could read it and end up completely okay.
    You could read it, then feel your brain start to decay
    You could read it, then feel your soul slipping away

    But what role do I play in this matter, you ask?
    I suppose you could call me ""the man in the mask""
    I'm The secret string-puller you never can meet
    That's the fate that I chose in my humble defeat

    But enough about me, we should talk about you
    You have just set me free; Would you like freedom, too?
    I can give it to you, and away we can float
    All I need is for you to read one little note

600|The Fire|"The sun flicks a sheen ‘cross her long curly hair

And reflects from the depths of her eyes of despair

And projects her despair through my skin to my soul

And injects in my heart, searing hot like a coal.

  &nbsp;

Now the coal in my heart spreads the flame to my veins

Coursing hot through the vessels, fire-cleansing my brain

Searing straight to my lungs, sucking air from my breath

Til the fire’s finished spreading its merciless death.

  &nbsp;

In the wake of the blaze, when the ashes have cooled

There I stand with the gaze of a guilt-ridden fool

And she stands with the eyes of a heartbroken child

Softly mourning the love that my lies have defiled.

  &nbsp;

But the fire left ashes in the place of my soul

And the hardening coals keep me weighted and cold

But she’s starting to freeze, and I must make her warm

So I relight my coals so she lives through the storm.

Pining for what

the sheets drift away  
genitals exposed.

Dignity is an afterthought  
at the end

I take in the scene;  
all of its horrific beauty.  
I stare deeply into his eyes

I feel you,  
I know you,  
I love you.  
I will share your pain  
for this moment

I am a hospice volunteer and this is based on one of my experiences with a patient.  The title refers to the patient, the illness, and the expected length of remaining life.  I am thinking about doing a series of these.

605|Will you would you, A poem by my active gang member friend whose afraid to post himself|"Will you would you

Will you be there if I fall

Would you pick me up or stall

Will you pull the trigger if I need you to

Would you do it or have to think it through

Will you make sure I have a place to go

Or would you tell me ""I don't know""

Will you smile with me

Or would you tell me that' not where you want to be

Will you walk with me hand in hand

Or would you say ""that's not my plan""

Would you watch my back while I watch yours

Or would you just be shoes and stores

Will you be loyal and hold it down

Or will you watch me kneel and stare at the ground

Will you shoot if I do

Or will you tell me not to

Will you be there 'till the end

Or would you fold and bend

Personally I think the kid has talent. He doen't have a reddit account or know what it is. I told him about my Iama and the response I got and he was interested. He is looking for feedback on his poetry. To quote him:

""Bro i b nervouse bout postin shit n pple readin them idk why lol i wish i could make a book lol""  

and ""N idk bro lol i guess just off pple not likeing it"".

Don't baby him, give him constructive feedback. I just wanna encourage him in this because it's something constructive for him to do and I truly believe he has a talent for it.

607|My Life|"**My Life**

&nbsp;

***
I sit here in silence where we both used to share laughs  
Remembering the times we were happy, when she was my other half  
She made me complete, in all sense of the word  
She gave me purpose, she gave meaning to my world,  

&nbsp;

Since she left everything fell apart, my heart broken, my mind even more so  
Her image burned into my mind never leaving, or is just me not letting go?  

&nbsp;

Is the pain in my soul her fault or is it mine?  
Is the pain my heart feels because she left?  
Or because I don't want her out of my mind?  

&nbsp;

I keep asking these questions again and again waiting for an answer  
Then I came to a realization that would change my life forever  

&nbsp;

The moment I start to live for someone is the moment I start to die  
When I start to change for another, my life becomes a lie  
So now I must live my life through my own choices  
To either cling on to the past and die slowly, or live for my sake and to forget her voices.

Day seeps into night,

Much like one falls in love.




Slowly.




We live and laugh,

Perceptions shift,

And we stare,

Barely seeing as our world reels.




And suddenly we wake,

Open our eyes,

And rejoice.




For we find no greater beauty,

Than our first look to the stars.

Announcement of rain, the rusted-out frame swallowed  
By a muddy bank tells there must  
Be some notion of the infinite, but  
One cannot get through the day without    
Next-doors screaming out at half-past that  
There is a place for everything in all  
Of this. See, the small roots of the old  
Tree breaking into the dumped air or a creek  
Overflowing the top of the dam, umbrellas carried  
On its brown-black, or the lightning-  
Bugs, in their unlit congregations, or a doormouse  
Dead and burst mark this the land  
Of rejection: the puzzle pieces you left  
In your pocket from Auntie Mildred's will not stop  
Haunting you; you've heard ghosts  
Were invented to account for shame. You wonder  
About colors and other projections.  

You told her in your last meeting that the door  
In her dreams was the key. She has never  
Dreamed of a door, but memory permits such  
Deceptions. You were told that at least  
One of your patients would begin to love  
You and hope idly while showering that this  
Might be the one. You were told that there are cures  
Worse than the disease. A flock of herons  
Migrates out of season&emdash;we all know not  
To read such things as signs. We are all wise.  

Still, it would be nice to have an alien  
Species pop by just to get a little bit  
Of confirmation, some gray-green guys  
At least interested enough in our anatomy (steel  
Mesh; things one thinks about in high-school  
Locker rooms). It is terribly exhausting to always  
Do things on one's own, to live beyond  
Measure. We think the rain is maybe stopping  
Now though we wish it wouldn't, as then no one has  
To survey the damages. And what is language,  
Anyways? What do we pay our therapists for  

If not that? A canvas bag bought from a supermarket  
For three dollars and fifty cents carrying  
Two books and a laptop in a branded carrying  
Case is better, one imagines, than the alternatives.  
White auras around the leaves with their thick  
Blue veins and dead branches hanging drooping  
Brown like bells pierce the gray-gray sky and one is forced  
To ask when all of it is so much  
extension how we can remember the dead.

They say that war would cease to be,

And countries would join hand in hand,

If only all the dead could speak;

Then all the world would understand.



But all the dead will never speak,

Nor do we care what they might say;

Or else we would be listening

To words the dying speak today.

and all the saints are just secret keeping sinners, or mediocre folks

Exceptional Evil is only the bedfellow of Ghandian Greatness.  
I told her the saints had been such selfish lovers lately.  
She said, you’ve got two hands,

He told me that travel is stupid

everyone is exactly the same

to love their spouses and mothers and children

When we sneak away into our seashell stashes

Some days when I look at the ocean she is a quilt of belonging  
ivory infinity folding over and over itself.  
Other days she is the silver specter of regret  
and a thousand seashells thrown into her mirror face  
get gobbled up  
with only gagging bubbles  
for protest.

613|Great Again - [LSD Sessions] (Updated)|"Updated to be a more complete poem. This is a performance-driven piece and is formatted in a way that helps me with tempo while reading. Hope you all enjoy! This forms part of the portion of my work that I call my LSD Sessions, which should be self-explanatory and is used more for my reference than anything else...hence the part of the title in brackets.

[**Scan of my typewritten hard copy.**](http://gradivis.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/22Great-Again22-e1484750425744.jpg) - this is the original as submitted here for reference, but the contents have been updated thanks to the wonderful community here on /r/OCPoetry. The discourse has been encouraging and enlightening.

&nbsp;

Great again.  
Great like ball games  
And road trips,  
American flags  
And church potlucks.  
Great like a home-cooked meal at six  
Respect for your elders  
And actual conversation.  
Great like homecoming dances  
And the national anthem;  
Love for Flag, God and Country,  
To thee, I pledge.  
Great like soda fountains,  
And Drive-Thru movies  
The Ten Commandments  
And those damn commie bastards.  
Great like   
The perpetual and proud roll of  
White-walled wheels  
Before Detroit   
Became a punchline.  

&nbsp;

Great again like  
Living the American Dream  
Presented on a   
Blasphemy-free beaming box  
Of blissful hope  
And life-changing appliances.  
Great like late-night shows  
And Rebels without a Cause  
Rat Pack rhymes  
And Blues that still had soul.  
Great like sacrosanct springing suburbs  
With two-car garages  
And no bursting bubbles  
Of greed, overflown.  
Great like the astral aspirations  
Of an entire generation  
And a race   
to the stars.  

&nbsp;

Great again like the mad men days  
Of slinging a two-bit smile at some broad  
And then a slap on the ass as she walks by  
Her inner rage subdued  
By the echoes of her high-heeled retreat  
And practice.  
Great like the end of the wife’s  
Goddamn nagging  
Being found at the beginning of a thumb  
Tightly grasping four fingers  
And delivered  
On the rocks.  
Great like choice found  
On the end  
Of a coat-hanger.  
  
&nbsp;

Great again like the good ol’ days  
Of white picket fences, made in the U.S.A.  
And white picket neighbours who were as well.  
Great like nuclear families  
With Nuclear dreams  
And a God-given right  
To 9mm of salvation.  
Great like the annihilation of ancestral abodes  
The promise of restitution   
Now just pipe dreams and tears.  
Great like the right kind over here  
And “your kind” over there  
Did you hear what I said to you, boy?  
Great like segregated schools for segregated homes,  
No unnatural unions of this or that nature  
None of that devil’s music and improper gyration  
No bathroom bills or gender improvisation  
All fixed behind closed doors with enforced reformation  
To Protect and to Serve just one population,  
And helped by the business end  
Of a truncheon.   
Great like good ol’ boy justice  
Served by shrouded mob  
And hooded robes  
Out of a dusty pickup at 2 am.  
They shoulda’ known their place,  
In this ‘great again’ nation.

I know this is by its very nature a topic prone to...*vigorous* discourse, but I hope the empathetic tone of my initial stanzas is clear. I have love for and lifelong relationships with people on all sides of the partisan divide, and I can understand how profound and powerful a role nostalgia can play in one's worldview. This is not a dig at traditional or conservative people, but an exploration of where the ""great again"" mindset once took this country.

Just a wee little rough draft I thought I'd put up here to the lens of critique."
616|The Park|"This is the story of a guy named Dwight

He was sad, he was lonely and he cried every night.

He wanted to be happy and he wanted to have friends

But he wasn’t and he didn’t and he wanted it to end.

So he laid in his bed and his self-hatred and the dark

Until one day he decided he would go to the park.

At the park there was a woman. She was sitting on a swing.

And Dwight looked at her and he forgot everything.

They took off their shoes and dug their feet in the sand

The woman smiled at Dwight and said her name was Marianne.

Marianne was an actress. She would soon be in a play

Dwight just smiled and nodded. He didn’t know what to say.

Marianne liked to read and cook and sing and dance and run

And she had pet hermit crabs that really really liked the sun.

They rocked back and forth with no shoes and no socks

Dwight liked to listen and Marianne liked to talk.

Dwight went home and for the first time felt all right

He was content, if not happy, when he went to bed that night.

The next day he joined a soccer league that played close to his home

He met new people, had new fun and even scored a goal.

On the next day he made waffles for some homeless in his town

He bought clay and started sculpting. He turned his life around.

In a year, he was happy. He was loved and he had friends.

He often thought of Marianne but he never saw her again.

617|Sleeping with Wrinkles.|"When you can’t get out of bed for a week after a breakup, 

You’ll eventually look around your room and ask how you accrued the following 10 items,

 1) 4 empty packs of cigarettes 

2) 2 used bottles of Stubbs barbecue sauce

 3) 1 Large pan 

4) 5 bowls

 5) More paper plates than you have letters in your full name 

6) More Jimmy John’s delivery bags than you can ever be proud of

 7) A castle made of Mountain Dew cans 

8) A full pack of tortillas 

9) Bubbles 

10) Her earrings 

After you find the last item, 

You will curl up like her smile, 

Then lay your head on her side of the pillow for a different point of view, 

There will be none, 

You will still be alone, 

Half of the sheet will come off your mattress, 

The other side will look as if it’s been slept in, 

As if you remember how she made every wrinkle, 

You’ll decide not to fix it, 

You’ll sleep on the side which is bare, 

You’ll think about how it’s better to be alone than to be left, 

That not even your sheets want any part of you, 

That you have way too many poems about being alone, 

And you’ll read all of them, 

They’re a hospice with a welcome mat, 

Brass knuckles wanting to shake on it,

 A heart falling asleep at the wheel, 

So I gave love a name, 

Mispronounced it, 

Because I won’t ever get love right,

 I wish just once I would, 

But there’s a fountain in my chest and I’m all out of change, 

So I swallowed a roll of quarters, 

Hoping one would find water, 

Then I got out of bed to see if superstitions were worth placing faith into, 

I went to my desk,

 Found a sharpie and wrote on my walls, 

“My heart is a glow stick and is bright from being broken,”

 Then I looked for a pen,

 Couldn’t find one because if we write the way we love our pens would leave us too

    Though cold like you, unmoved and silent grown,  
    my heart however dying, has yet to turn to stone;  
    It can still hope, despair, resent and regret,  
    Conceal, disdain — can do all things but forget.  
    Here I stand, where you made dust from gold;  
    Where I had the winning hand, I now long to fold.  
    But I know for you, here I must stay;  
    Sad proof how well a lover can obey.  
    Not your death, nor mine, can break the lasting chain;  
    It is will, it is law, it is nature — that our love shall remain.  
    So I promise I will wait, till all the flames resign;  
    then, only then, will your spirit again be fused with mine.

620|I'll Leave You When I Need To|"We're together, it's euphoric, a sensation that I love.  
A needle sent down to my arm from Heaven up above.  
The lows seem unimportant when I'm riding out the highs.  
We're together, it's euphoric, I lean back and close me eyes.  

The rush that you provide is always knocking at my door.  
You batter and demean me, but I find I'm craving more.  
My sanctuary now is the opaqueness of my mind.  
I'll leave you when I need to, but for now I'm doing fine.

I was reunited with this old feeling  
And briefly, actually thought I was healing  
But you merely thought of love as a chore  
So you’ve hurt me more

I told myself this wasn’t fair  
While you sat there playing with your hair  
I thought I felt better calling you a whore

Thanks,

Let them rain from the sky

like little 

memory thieving smarties

Easter egg colors.

We'll catch them in our hands

and stuff them in our mouths

until

we've lost track

of how many,

and ""Where's my phone?

Someone call it.

Be quiet!

Guys!

Shut up!

Ok, got it.""

We said,

""We'll be there in,

like,

fifteen minutes.""

But we never left

cause,

""Sam is fucking 

Rachel,

and she's too barred out

and he doesn't want to go anymore

and he was our ride,

We'll try again 

tomorrow.

Won't we?

625|God Is A Bad Texter|"If I had God's phone number

The first thing I'd ask is, ""wait how did I get this number?""

But the first thing I'd ask God is, ""what's up with Jaden Smith, like really?""

And the second thing I'd say is

""Thank you for Emma Watson. Heart eye emoji..

..And for baconators. Two heart eye emojis""

See, if I had God's phone number, he'd probably block me

Because I'd ask him things like

""So, is me having super powers off the table"" or

""no seriously, what is up with Jaden Smith?""

I'd ask him

""How many hail Mary's until you make Pokémon real"" or

""How's the signal up there in heaven? Because I don't think you've been getting my messages""

If I had God's phone number I'd send him things like

""Thank you for making sure I didn't die in my sleep"" or

""Did you make it so that humans couldn't fly for a reason or were you just being a jerk?""

If I had God's phone number

I'd ask him ""where are you?""

Because things aren't too good down here and I think we may need some divine intervention

But everyone keeps saying you have a plan

If I had God's phone number

I'd ask him what that ""plan"" was

Because I hear a lot of people talking about it

I'd ask him if diseases and natural disasters were really necessary

I'd ask him where in this ""master plan"" he managed to fit racism and hatred

I'd remind him of the massacres in his name

I'd remind him of the Crusades, people set aflame because their faith was different

If I had God's phone number

I'd ask him if it was hard to condemn his son to death to absolve our sins only to have the world end up like this

I'd ask him, from father to son why some kids have to grow up without parents that love them

I'd ask him why some kids have to grow up without parents at all

If I had God's phone number

I'd ask him if there was a ""plan b""

Because obviously ""plan g-o-d"" isn't working

I'd ask him to bring back Michael Jackson because the world needs something to smile at

I'd ask him to make sure Beyoncé never dies because we need someone to look up to and apparently, its not you

If I had God's phone number

I'd ask him if those spiteful lines of scripture on those angry peoples picket signs actually mean anything

I wonder if those bible verses were meant to sound so violent

I'd ask him if what they're saying is true because if it is, your unconditional love comes with an unconventional contract

I'd ask him ""how can you be all loving with so many exceptions to your own rules?""

If I had God's phone number

I'd ask him ""do you even believe in us?""

Because maybe there's a reason we aren't feeling your love

Y'know, I'm starting to think the rainbows you put above our heads are just empty promises

If I had God's phone number

I'd ask him where he was during my depression

Why he watched my recession toward death and did nothing about it

I lost track of how many messages I've sent to him that could've been my last words

But I can count how many replies I've gotten on less than one hand

If I had God's phone number

I'd call him to ask ""did you really need to take my best friend so early?""

""Just make sure he's in a better place now because I don't want that red line across his neck to be for nothing""

And, I've made that call before

But I got sent to voice mail

If you had God's phone number

I'd tell you to not bother texting him

I'd tell you to delete it

Because I've had his number for a while now

And I've sent all of those messages

I think God might be out of service

So I sent him one more message saying ""I don't think I believe in you anymore""

""Read at 3:21 am"""
626|Reality|"There once was a boy, an innocent child  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whose heart was filled with dreams  
He dreamed of love, success, and joy  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mountains, green pastures, and streams.  
He had no fear for the world was kind  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or so to him it seemed.  
But as he aged, he found the truth  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And saw that it would mean  
An end to love, success, and joy  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mountains, green pastures, and streams.  
Instead he was faced with horrors untold

memories

of 



yesterday

patches of emotion





While I fall endlessly

&nbsp;

&nbsp;
Through the slow degradation of melancholia
&nbsp;

&nbsp;



The big Avenidas of my long lost city, the anxious and provocative chileans, strolling around and screaming about


Trying to make sense of their living, while I try to make plans to return


Like a King without a crown, among the peasantry 



Beautiful late summer evenings, in the city surrounded by mountains, there's a fine smell of warmth and liquor

Oh I miss those distorted latinamerican nights, Oh how I yearn

629|I don't write about love|"I don't write about love. I don't write about rose petals, chocolate shaped hearts or giant, ill-proportioned teddy-bears. I don't write about crimson red lips or dainty hands, held in a palm that's afraid to lose them. I don't write about together forever palm readings or marriage or in vitro fertilisation because sperm count was low. I don't write about gum rings as a cute substitute. I don't write about quote placards, hung on adjacent walls with adjoining messages. I don't write about growing old together, family homes or the ever-unpresent daughter and the associated frustrations. I don't write about the weeks since you left. I don't write about sitting at home, gnawing at my knuckles til my cheeks ache. I don't write about pencils, snapped in frustration at the speechless, writelessness I feel. I don't write about punctuation; my sentence is a long one and the commas misplaced, the colons setting up lists of listlessness and the full stops always turning into 'what-if' ellipses. I don't write about love. I write about fear, and holes, and crying at house viewings

I spit it out like blood between my teeth   
A hangnail that dug into the pink of my gums that throbbed it

Out here you can see forever suspended   
In the space between the stars  
Orion’s belt wrapped round my bloody knuckles  
Thrashing out to lick at my own skin  
Like: a cat’s tongue  
Like: a tongue of flame  
Like: a tongue of a lover with knives instead of teeth

I let him slice into me and  
Slice me open and   
My heartline’s bleeding out onto the damp earth  
A crimson constellation and  
If only I could swallow it again and  
Lock it up behind my bared grin.

It would be mine  
All mine  
Forever suspended   
in the hollow of my throat   
Until Sirius sinks his canines in and  
Shakes me like a rag doll and   
Tosses my fragments up   
To glimmer in the ink.

Don’t look for me, stargazer.

I already found you.

634|(Untitled, being a section of a longer work entitled, Tapes to a Dead Man)|"There's a rainbow there, though there wasn't a rain 

And its colors are distant, like a closet's closed door 

Had opened to reveal long-dead wardrobes 

And the dust of sunken colors in a swirl of moths. 

When I think of you I think of shipwrecks, bodies 

Washed ashore in a land away from the lives they led, 

And a crowd pushing down to the verge of the beach 

To picture the carnage in scrapbooks years later, 

Faded snapshots whose edges tore like insects' wings. 

The rainbow time has come again, and yet it hasn't, 

I can feel the desire burning, and yet I cannot, 

The distance of those days I measure in closed doors.

635|smoke break|"
it's fucking cold/and I'm wearing your nice coat/that you stole from your cousin who knocked your teeth out one Christmas/and you're wearing the shittier one because

well, because you're secretly really sweet to me

and I'm hanging off your shoulders/while I french inhale tobacco smoke/and you try to french inhale your frozen breath

you fool

and it's really fucking cold and you beg me to go inside/but it's quite clear that I have about four more minutes on this marlboro red here/and I quote that scene in sex and the city/ when the man won't let carrie smoke

""sir I have an addiction""

and you tell me I kind of look like sarah jessica parker/and I want to take it as a compliment/ but I'm not really sure if you meant it as sort of a jab

but your smile is very cute when you say it

and I tell you that you're grown/and that you have free will and autonomy/and that you can go inside if you want

but you don't, obviously

and you slide your hands under my coat/your coat/and put your hands on my waist/and they're so fucking cold/and I yelp and I giggle

and your smile grows even bigger

revealing those fake front teeth/that are just a slightly different color/from the ones that didn't get the business from your drunk cousin

and really, they look nice

and the song playing inside/drifts from the crack in the patio door/dance yrself clean/that lcd sound system song I sent you/when we were a thousand miles apart/both home for christmas

and I missed you so so bad but I didn't want to tell you that outright

because we promised to keep it casual/even though it isn't that at all/and we depend on one another as a sort of crutch in this cold and unfamiliar place

and sometimes you tell me you love me when you're really drunk and it's late at night

so I send you any song that I like if it has a synth in it/because you told me once that you like electronic music/and I don't really know what that means

but you told me you really like this song

so I put it on every playlist/to ensure that there's always a song that appeals to you when we're hanging out together/since you always let me play the music because

well, because you're secretly really sweet to me

and we're silent while it plays this time/and your hands have warmed up on my naked skin/and you just kind of hold me there/and sway a little bit/while I take one last long drag on this marlboro red

and I want to scream it out loud on this sober evening how much I love you

but instead I just drop the butt of this cigarette on the ground/and twist the sole of my tennis shoe over it/to snub the tiny ember/and we walk inside

wordlessly, no longer touching

and when the weather is warm again/six short months later/we part ways for the last time/and I give you a burned cd

the last song is dance yrself clean

but I don't write that on the track list/because it seems really corny/and we agreed to keep it casual

and I still don't want to let on that I know it's not

and that was years ago now/but I remember it as though my days are still punctuated by cigarette runs to the 711/and as though you still stand in front of the mirror, consciously inspecting your new teeth/and as though you never packed up and moved a thousand miles away

as though you still text me to come over even though basketball is on and you're going bitch about my smoke breaks

and I hear that song sometimes/because it still appears on almost every playlist I make/dance yrself clean/and I remember that night on the patio/and I remember how badly I missed you when I first sent you the link to it /and I remember how badly I missed you when you left

and I want to scream it out loud how much I still love you

screaming from her room only amplified the situation

my father's temper never capped

holes in the wall

broken plates

my mother with tears shooting down her face

Everything feels right

And when we are

In this tight embrace

Found my place

To your chest

Can finally rest

 When I am cold

You keep me warmed

And in your arms

I can't be harmed

When you return

The love I give

You are the reason

I want to live

And when i see you

With your arms open

I always feel happy

That I was chosen

When there's nothing

Left for us to say

In my arms

Where you lay

I love when you

Put me beside your heart

I feel like that's when

I never did.

So thank you Papa John, 

seriously. 

My ass always beckoned 

to grow and blow 


From your shitty pizza. 

Now I’ll say no. 

I should have said it sooner.

Masochism. 


Self harm, I’m a cutter,

I just use food.

And your shitty slices

did hurt so good.


I’ll have to find other

fat ways to slice

myself open in pain,

Those lactose blades. 


Yeah, your shitty pizza

did slice so deep.

But your dumb racist ass?

You weird old creep…


Diabetes looming,

for we fat souls,

The slices for slices

to take our toes.


It’s the devil we choose,

And so it goes.

But next time I’ll order,

The water here is too shallow

Papaw warned me not to waste a good hook  
caught on something under the murky water.

There's a power line in the front yard now

Rusted hook swings in the wind.

647|Gee Dash Dee|"When I was six I had this  
idea, this image  
about holiness, that holy was a  
chair.  

&nbsp;

It was Sunday School, she was  
talking  
was scraping chalk and she said  
G-d Is In Everything  
and wrote it too, mysterious middle dash,  
in the looping cursive of a Grown Up  
which looped the way a whisper does  
when a Grown Up says something looping  
it must be true.  

&nbsp;  

And she looped to us  
sitting in that semicircle  
G-d Is The Hills  
The Earth  
and her hands shook   
spun down like melty ice cream  
The Spirit Hears You and Knows You  
And He Is Here,  
In The Beauty Of A Sunrise  
(even in this room? I raised my hand)  
Even In That Chair  
she smiled  
Even In You.  
  
&nbsp;

My chair was orange plastic  
worn down in the center  
stray jean fibers from a different kid  
were wrapped around a loose seat screw,  
it had three holes in the back  
pencil marked  
a doodle of a boxer with fists  
and I whispered Gee Dash Dee, are you in there?  
I’m sitting on you  
Gee did not reply  
I was in his mouth.  
  
&nbsp;

We went to Olive Garden that night  
the pasta looped like cursive  
and I thought I saw him in my spaghetti.  

&nbsp;

My toothbrush was probing for a holy thing between my teeth  
and I asked  
Can you walk backwards through years  
and undrop me from the sky?  
Would it be that easy?  
and I spit Gee out in the sink.  

&nbsp;

And I came back, last year,  
to that old dusted room  
they replaced the chalkboard with markers  
my teacher was gone but  
the chairs were the same  
and I thought about the chairs,  
were they always  
this small?

648|A Joke about Flowers|"
The poppy-rose, sea-rose, and rose-rose walk into a bar.  

The poppy-rose says, “I am effulgent with sober wonder,  
douse me with you darkest spirits.”  

A cool rain washed down the bar and settled into the rust  
the poppy-rose gripped. “Now I can die.”  

The sea-rose say’d, “Lord witness my crucifixion!”  

And he did,  
and the whole bar laughed.  

The rose-rose said nothing and was quiet and was ashamed  
and did not wilt.

653|On seeing and being seen|"Probably there are people who could live in California

and never notice the red and green shouldering the sky and the clouds

pouring over the mountainside and down like syrup

dripping onto thirsty yarrow and swirling.

&nbsp;

And probably there are people who overlook the Grand Canyon

and complain about the traffic and worry someone might fall

worse than blind to the breathtaking ferocity of a river\-gnawed

planet revealing its layers and begging to be seen.

&nbsp;

And probably there are people who can stand knees deep in a meadow

without smelling the heated pollen breeze of future flowers

and without hearing the ardent buzz of head, abdomen, and thorax

seeking head, abdomen, and thorax in the dwindling hours

allowed before the inevitable frost.

&nbsp;

Probably there is someone who could stand beneath a full moon

and not feel the unearthly pull of romantic desire to

visit, to hold the curve of that surface under one's own hand,

to surrender to the gravity of the tides and to feel one's body

rock and sway in the gentlest of lights deserving to be seen.

and those days I mainly feel this way.

As I ponder the rain, and the plains of Spain

No drive to work, or urge to play

until the dark clouds fade away.

And with them from my shoulders take

the burdens that most heavily weigh.

Allowing the sun to shine it’s light,

and clear the fog behind my eyes.

Giving way to take safe flight

down my foreseen path once it dries.

"" ""

For now though I must sit and wait

using this time as a needed break.

To take count of what is most at stake,

and which things of mine I must forsake.

"" ""

Though doing so may cause some pain,

and my face to turn wet from facing the rain.

But it must be done, and done this way.

All in the hopes that there will come a day

where the sun is bright, and there to stay.

for those days that were mainly gray.

the skin and the bones,
the life that you chose,

the blankets too hot and the air is too cold,
you're too young to know yet you feel you're so old,

the beer cans collect and the cigarette butts piled,

a colony of wood lice scrambling from dirt  
caked in the rotted legs;   
spiraling seeds from the sycamore  
gathered in the pits of the knots;  
golden ladybugs, mid-coitus, hiding in the joinery;  
wizened spiders laying dust eggs atop  
a cluster of rusted screw heads.  
I sat upon an ant parade

A channel of white paint and insect bodies  
gutters the drain. My table gleams

    We floated through life
    like pollen on the wind,
    effervescent, relentless,
    wild to roam.  Before
    the snow came to pierce our bones.

    We have wilted, forgotten
    beneath the quilt of sorrow
    come from the skies.  

    We have scorched, abandoned
    left to fester in the stark high sun
    blackened and withered
    as the beetles eat from us.

as he does every morning:  
hair tousled, eyes bleary,  
a stuffed animal dangling

and no camera's flash can preserve 
the preciousness of the moment.  
The span and intensity of a clock's tick;  
an ache like a clenched fist inside me  
for the intensity of what is  
and the unfairness of knowing it will vanish  
into time and memories.  
Something that is commonplace today  
will become a fleeting thought of tomorrow  
and eventually the photos and words  
are all that will remain—  
save for this one tiny spot in my heart,

    Anxiety has a tireless maw. I need disgusting wealth.
    Three passports. A bunker in Montana.
    Another in New Zealand. My assets diversified
    to include cryptocurrencies, crop seeds, solar grids.
    
    I need forty supplements a day, a San Francisco dietician,
    two life extension research teams scouring
    graduate students’ papers, and a personal assistant
    enlisting me in promising medical trials.
    
    I need Ayahuasca sessions, crystal healing,
    USB-C DMT vaporizers, telepathic instructions
    from the Iboga root. I need pure and radical love
    to cross through our flimsy meat-forms
    and pulverize the thirty years of anxiety
    collected like the secondary growth of a tree
    in my silly, white, plump, stumpy body.
    
    Swiping this $1,200 phone streams white noise
    over the monster whispering *kill yourself.*
    Maybe happiness is in the monk somewhere
    sitting in the mountains. Maybe
    it’s in the gradual climb out of poverty.
    Maybe I sit in tears on the backs of slaves.
    No sympathy for me, and none deserved.

662|The Mathematician|"Your problem’s unconventional,   
and seems multidimensional,   
but closely viewed, it is, in fact,   
a tempest in a tesseract.    
A substitution should be tried;    
it’s just a cube, when simplified.   
Once it's a cube you’re halfway there:   
project your problem to a square,    
and then your problem, rendered flat,   
can probably be left at that.  
Not satisfied? You could consign   
your problem to a finite line,   
reduce it to a single point,   
then prove its membership disjoint   
from all the sets belonging to   
the set of things that trouble you.   
Therefore, as you can plainly see,    
there is no problem. _Q.E.D._    
&nbsp;   
My husband, as he often does,     
finds fault in all these algebras.    
“Don’t confuse,” he says to me,   
“the model with reality.”   
But problems, being what they are —   
of science, or of some crossed star —   
just never seem to be designed   
to fit a mathematician's mind.

    or the pressure cooker’s shriek.  
    This house has watched me grow,  
    Ten to twenty-one.  
    Served as nest and chrysalis.  
    Still growing to be done.  


II)

    without my parents,   
    Was mine, and mine and real.  
    And I paid the bills,  
    And I fixed what broke,  
    This flat is where I healed.  
    Where happy crept in with the sun  
    warming the floor under my feet,  
    With the sound of London living  
    At night as I fell asleep.  


III)   
    Your arms feel a lot like  
    lying on clean sheets   
    after a long day.  
    I can sit  
    in your comforting silence,  
    When I don’t have words to say,

    I splash some water on my face,
    and I look in the mirror.
    I'm growing old.
    I was once impatient with growing old.

    The longer I stare, the more I wonder
    when I am truly old,
    old enough to mask my fragility 
    with wisdom,
    if the gods will be kind 
    to my memory.

    I haven't forgotten those
    who stood before me
    when I was a boy.
    I haven't forgotten
    what time has done to them.
    I wonder if they've
    forgotten me.

sparkling.

667|The world's longest drunk text|"[This piece has been in the works for much longer than most things I write, which makes it feel a bit sporadic and incoherent in my opinion. However, I feel like that fits the context]

I got 99 problems drowned out in that 80 proof

And your phone rings cuz there's like four things I had to say to you

On my stumble back home, my face a shade of blue

And I wish I could get my number back from that girl that I gave it to

Cuz I know she's just a plug for the area that's been sinking

That you had left with me and that's why you got me drinking

Now it's Evan Williams or some Jack Daniels and a little Coke

Hoping I can fake forget how you left me a little broke

Because what I thought was serious you saw as a little joke

Thought I felt a spark but soon it was up in smoke, damn

Now I'm a bit choked up

Bout to throw stuff

You can watch me go nuts

I miss your Crosley vinyl player and that one record that skips

Woke up without you and thought damn all that effort for this?

And I know that it's your birthday so you got a new dude in bed with you

But I fucked last night just to stay a step ahead of you

I used to catch you smiling and you'd say it was about me

Now I know you're smiling and it hurts cuz it's without me

So I'll just tuck myself in and forget it until tomorrow

When I wake up and crack another bottle for the sorrow

Someday, when the sun shines

someday we’ll spend all day outside, I promise.  
And we’ll build a tree fort,  
and dance barefoot in the grass  
and I’ll count all of your freckles.   
And then we can sit in the pixie-dust sunshine  
picking daisies and making dandelion wishes   
and I’ll crown you King Of All The Flowers, would you like that?   
And we can go to the beach, if you want,   
and wave at the waves,  
and dig for seashell treasures that match your abalone eyes,  
and then we can build a castle, just for the two of us.   
And if we just think enough happy thoughts  
maybe we’ll float,  
maybe we’ll fly, just like your kite;  
as free as kites, you and me,

A maid from the Island of Wight,  
Renowned as incredibly tight,  
Had lovers who'd wail  
When their exits would fail.  
They're stuck with her all through the night.

&nbsp;

A serial killer called ""Skinner"",  
Saw victims become somewhat thinner.  
With great expectations  
He sent invitations  
To guests he was having for dinner.

&nbsp;

There once was a beautiful lass  
Possessed of an oversize ass.  
There was no surprise  
When it doubled in size,  
When fed a rich diet of grass. 

&nbsp;

Lorena wished Bobbit was dead.  
She sliced through his member in bed.  
Then Dahmer found out,  
So he gave her a shout.   
""Are you gonna eat that?"" he said.

A curious princess named Alice  
Tried dynamite sticks for a phallus.  
Repetitive thrusts  
And the dildo combusts.  
There's bits of her all through the palace.

&nbsp;&nbsp;It's really not so hard to hold   

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;my heart inside your own. I'm told 

&nbsp;&nbsp;you never know how hot or cold  

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;you think that I might like it.  


&nbsp;&nbsp;  


&nbsp;&nbsp;You claim I've got to open up,  

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;decant myself in Dixie Cups.   

&nbsp;&nbsp;You say I've got to be “grown-up”  

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and that you can't be psychic.   


&nbsp;&nbsp;  


&nbsp;&nbsp;You treat me like some Mystick Booke,  

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a puzzle to be solved, a hook   

&nbsp;&nbsp;without a verse or song, mistook  

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for any fleeting woman.   


&nbsp;&nbsp;  


&nbsp;&nbsp;You think, if only you could find   

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the perfect mix of drugs and wine  

&nbsp;&nbsp;then I would fall in love in time:  

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;an *ex post facto* romance.   


&nbsp;&nbsp;  


&nbsp;&nbsp;But what if I'm already yours   

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and all your machinations were   

&nbsp;&nbsp;the bumblings of a saboteur-  

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;not to be praised, but pitied.   


&nbsp;&nbsp;  


&nbsp;&nbsp;It's no great secret.  Take it slow   

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and steady; don't make some grand show.   

&nbsp;&nbsp;Just hold me close and don't let go   

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and tell me that I'm pretty.

Guys and gals, *thank you* so so much for the lovely feedback.  Hearing so many of you say that this touched you and brought a little spark of joy into your life really makes me feel wonderful.  That's why I write - to give out into the world a little bit of what the world has given me.  To share it around the table.  That way, the heavy burdens feel a little lighter, and the joyful moments seem to shine a little brighter.  

So thank you for spending a moment at my table.  I love you all.  I'll see you on the next one.  "

674|Whole Foods and Poetry|"""Milf Alert!"" Johnny said

As I'm lost, floating through my own brain

""Dude"", he said, as if it were my name,

""Look at the ass on that one.""

As a woman, in her mid-30s,

Blonde hair, pony tail, yoga pants,

Bends over to tie the shoes of her obviously autistic son.

'

""Yeah man, nice."" I say as I try to find my way back

To my familiar, cozy, melancholy haze

""It's just this place, is just fucking loaded with talent, dude.""

""There's the yoga place, right next door.""

""And like, only chicks who care about their appearance come

here, right?""

'

Looking into the cereal aisle, Johnny continues,

""I should apply here. It's probably less money than Mack Shack,

but Jeeezus Christ, look at all this talent.""

The woman in front of us struggles with the weight of her

bags,

A shade off from perfectly matching the ones under her eyes.

She's bald, you can tell even though she wears a cap,

Chalk-white and half-dead,

Rail thin,

Weak - you can just tell.

I saw her five minutes before, carefully studying the ingredients of her seaweed salad.

I'm rooting for her to make,

But she glances back at me with a look

That tells me she won't.

Johnny asks me,

""You know who's probably fucking great in bed?""

He answers for me, ""Ava. She's a yoga instructor now.""

'

There's a long silence in the car until Johnny interrupts,

""What's the point of fucking roses?""

""They're expensive. They just die.""

""You look at them once, go 'Oh, that's nice'""

""And then you throw it in the trash.""

He laughs.

""Just sticks with thorns"", I say.

He laughs again.

'

""Watch where you're going, you just almost ran over that

Mexican lady and made me spill your... quinoa... you faggot.""

I nod.

I miss the turn a minute later.

""Shit can't you see.""

""Just zombies bro, everywhere I go.""

He laughs again.

'

We went to the bar later that night.

Johnny killed it with every girl he talked to.

It was really an amazing thing to watch.

I sat on my stool and barely blinked as the whiskey seemed to refill itself.

A girl much younger than I came up to me and asked,

""Why do you look so sad?""

I forget my response, but it was something witty and she laughed.

I had sex with her that night,

And then never talked to her again.

I told my girlfriend several days later and she broke up with me.

Last week, I sent them both a dozen roses,

Anonymously.

Sending their poetry onto the world    
Instantaneously,
At the tapping of a screen. 

Not waiting to take breath,    
Nor ink to dry,    
Never posing the question

Never stopping for revision,

Yes she brightens up my day

By the pure fire burning in her soul

&#x200B;

She knows who I am

Yet we've never exchanged a word

I don't care, how much more blood I have to spill

If only,

I can get to her

To just look at her, every single day

So I know, 

This is real

So I don't have to keep telling myself,

This is real

The golden,

Glittering silk under the sun

I wish to kiss her rosy cheek

So enticing

Just like the forbidden fruit

679|Mr Nobody|"**Mr Nobody:**

We enter each others lives at unforeseen times with no rhyme or reason as to how or why. We share ourselves with one another or at least enough to keep us tethered together.

But who am I to you apart from text on screen? Yes, we tether ourselves together but it’ll never be forever. We lead separate lives, in parallel, destined to never come together.

For I am a nobody a stranger in the street ready to be disposed of when you find a better piece of meat. Are you even real or just a figment of my imagination? Because all my life it feels like I’ve been living in a simulation. 

You text me at five in the morning and ask to chat, I smile kindly and we do just that. We end the call and before you know it weeks have passed since I’ve seen your face, I long  for your embrace. 

It was born out of a transaction but grew into more than sexual satisfaction. I shared myself with you and from that I grew. Your words cemented in my head, things I can’t forget... just yet. Yet they are expected to be erased without a trace.


Will we ever meet again? I hope so but if not I wish you well. For time passes, memories fade, but you’ve still left an indelible mark on my brain.

680|Rewriting Eternally|" 

I keep finding myself in this predicament,

Where I’m continuously typing and deleting,

Until the thing which I really meant,

Has been lost in hapless bleating.

&#x200B;

Even now as I write you a new poem,

I can’t help….

Oops,

No that’s not quite right…

&#x200B;

Let me try again,

To express myself correctly,

It can sometimes be a pain,

No, I’ve said that incorrectly.

&#x200B;

Rather an issue unsolved by time or reason,

Like writers block for chat,

My mind’s committing treason,

And here we are again, all meaning fallen flat.

&#x200B;

So, I ask you, please excuse my backtracking,

I’m sorry for my rambling and bumbling,

I swear to you I’m not just slacking,

And I’m sorry for always mumbling.

&#x200B;

I promise I’m getting to my subject,

It’s just I still need to process what I want to say,

But every time I look back and reflect,

I have to ask, “What was I trying to convey?”

&#x200B;

It’s like an addiction,

I keep on writing without any real end,

Until suddenly it’s become some fiction,

That I must go back and mend.

&#x200B;

Wait…

Where am I now?

What was the point of all that?

Let me try again! Just once more I swear!

&#x200B;

You see, I’ve never had this much trouble,

It’s like you genuinely make me speechless,

I’ll get an idea, and it pops like a bubble,

And then I’m left there blank and breathless.

&#x200B;

But it’s actually a kind of wonderful feeling,

It’s like composing a piece for a beautiful princess,

While I think of how I’ll deliver it, “perhaps kneeling!”

No, not that, that would be weird.

&#x200B;

But something like that,

Because romance isn’t dead,

It’s beautiful, and vibrant and all that,

It's a cause for which some bleed red.

&#x200B;

So I'm back at it with pen held aloft, 

Drenched in earnest glee,

And if my thoughts grow weak or soft,

I’ll think about you and me.

&#x200B;

Well, you and I is proper grammar,

However this is a poem,

And rules must be bent to aid in its glamour,

Did you know that hardly anything rhymes with poem?

&#x200B;

I'm at an odd point in the writing of this,

Where I don't really remember what I wanted to say in the first place,

And I can't make heads or tales of where to end, 

So I should probably find an end, or at least say something that holds some meaning. 

&#x200B;

I guess what I want to tell you…

Is that I think you're amazing,

You're beautiful, smart, 

and wonderfully kind.

&#x200B;

You always put a little pep in my step,

And though you may not be ready,

I will sit patiently until eternity ends.

Believe me, I’m stubborn enough.

&#x200B;

So that’s what I wanted,

Rather needed,

To tell you,

Sorry it took so long.

&#x200B;

Wrapping up this travesty of a poem,

I'm glad I've said my piece.

Again nothing rhymes with poem,

And with that this poem can finally cease.

wondering if his souvenir stall  

was just a little extra busy today.  

Stirring a pot of beans and rice  

heated on an open fire  

bought with a piece of their $125 a month.

My community loved to lament that fact  

that such a hardworking and honorable people  

had so little. Build houses, share the Good News.  

Do the Lord’s work. They also loved to call  

undocumented immigrants  

“illegals.”

&#x200B;

We're seated in a cargo van, eating churros  

heading back toward hot showers  

and clean running water  

Praising God that we saved these people's souls.

&#x200B;

Somewhere back in Tijuana  

a desperate mother scoops rainwater  

from a barrel with a dead rat at the bottom  

and hopes that the cartel moves slower in the dark.

684|i fell in love with someone broken|"i fell in love with someone broken

she’s at unreachable heights

impossible infatuations welling up

true feelings, unspoken

we were lost souls that have resonated

blended so well, is it meant to be?

eternity is unforgiving

trapped inside the cycle of loneliness

finally understanding the true emotion

only wanting the best for each other

heartless soul, turned full

waiting for time, while dancing this suicidal slow dance 

no longer empty, her smiles bring joy 

spilling her mind, as a knife jabs my heart

only wanting to hold her ever so tightly

wanting her to smile truly again

wishing she finds her light

content with platonic, i’m afraid of the unknown

no longer on the climb, to the unreachable peak

my mind slips, as i fantasize this false reality

catching onto the vicious stings of her life

ruining my mind, this affection is dragging

know she doesn’t look at me the way i look at her

sunken, as i’ve fallen so low

my soul is damaged, the light has dimmed

mind turned grey, as the colors fade away

i fell in love with someone, broken

685|The moon keeps on rising|" 

The journey continues as the moon keeps on rising, 

Shining a light higher and brighter into the Sky

And I ask you: keep rising, 

Let me see that confidence growing

Glowing across your face, 

Radiate the energy upon us 

So that we smile back at you

As our crescent protrudes 

And turns into a Gibbous. 

We’re approaching the Peak

And still the journey continues..

686|The Endless Night|"I found you in the Darkness,

And sat down by your side.

Forevermore, beside you, 

I promised to reside.

&#x200B;

As the shadows crept around us,

I whispered stories of the Light.

My efforts, though in vain,

Held back the endless night.

&#x200B;

In solitude, I'd never leave you,

To battle on your own.

The blackness, still and silent,

Would never be your home.

&#x200B;

How I longed to see you rise!

And from the Darkness do depart.

I refused to watch you suffer,

Or let you fall apart.

&#x200B;

But my hubris got the best of me,

Foolishness and pride.

I failed you, my darling,

A sin I can't abide.

&#x200B;

A year we sat together.

The sands of time did fall.

I never saw it coming,

on hands and knees, I crawl.

687|My first time posting here. Actually, my first time ever sharing|"  **A Mystery**

&#x200B;

I see your face everywhere I look.

You took my world by storm,

a Blitzkrieg of my mind,

and like lightning, you vanished all too fast.

Post-haste, you became my centerpiece,

a day to day unachievable notion.

You taunt me with omnipresence;

yet at all times you are a million miles away.

You haunt my spirit with fascinating relevance,

a blistering, persistent scar of the past,

yet your face is as new as each day is young.

Try as I may to push you away,

my being won’t allow you to leave me.

It’s as if our presences must always coexist,

yet a bonding is a promise of failure.

My heart demands my effort with logic-free argument,

I am the actor of its will and unwittingly obey my orders.

I mean no harm, but am still far below your character.

To be good enough is to become a god

or the manifestation of malevolence itself.

Who you are or truly aim to be will remain a mystery unto me,

it’s not to be said that you yourself yet know."

I’ll think of it,





If I remember to save this as a draft.





After a few craft beers.





Because alcoholics only drink cheap.




I’m not one, but I could be.




Or rather I would be,




If I focused.

I’m really fucking tired.




Of writing these because…




Well I don’t know why.




Maybe because these days it's all I can write.




I just stare at a white page,




And try to will some happiness or rage.




To stay motivated.




To stay focused.

I’m burnt out,




But I can't stop or I'll think,




About how things have turned…




Probably shouldn’t rhyme out with out,




If I can’t keep it consistent I’ll go without.




Fuck I did it anyway.





I’m sure inspiration could hit me any day now.





It's all so out of focus.

689|"I DON""T WANT TO WRITE A SESTINA"|"Note: My very best friend challenged me to write a sestina. For the life of me, I couldn't do it. So, I wrote a poem about why I WAS NOT going to write one.We had a great laugh over it, and I finally managed to churn out a sestina...2 years later.







I DON'T want to write a sestina,  
I've much better things I can do  
Like picking my nose in the mirror  
Or counting my steps to the loo.  


But Marcus insists I should write one.  
""A simple sestina"", says he.  
""Just something to give you a challenge.  
Expand your creativity.""  


So I actually started to write one.  
I took out my pencil and pad.  
And that's when it suddenly hit me.  
I knew I had almost been had!  


He's entered a poetry contest.  
He's done this before (I surmise).  
He's going to use my sestina  
And with it, he'll win the first prize.  


He's trying to steal all my wisdom.  
And suck all the skills from my brain.  
He's going to pilfer my talents.  
And use them for ill-gotten gains.  


He'll win a gazillion of dollars  
He'll gain lots of fortune and fame.  
And when he receives all his honors.  
He won't even mention my name.  


HIS name will be plastered in neon.  
His face on a webpage will be.  
He'll make like the Frito Bandido.  
He'll run off to Europe! Sí! Sí!  


My best friend is plotting against me?  
Our friendship is going to wane?  
For a few fleeting moments of glory?  
A labor of love down the drain?  


Well, THAT'S why I'm NOT gonna write one.  
Oh Yeah, Mr. Sneaky! You'll see!  
You're NOT gonna get a sestina.  
At least you won't get it from ME.

690|Two cents gets your throat slit|"Sober wobble worse than broken tables

Hands shake like a thirsty drunk

A rusty screw turns to ratchet tension

I wonder what’s inside this leather trunk

It only takes a second to open up

But once it’s open, it can not be shut.

Two shirts and a suit coat

Two cents gets your throat slit

That’s why I’m throwing all my pennies

Towards the wishing well

Hoping one will land 

And help me write a rent check

But I’d rather write a poem

‘Bout a southern girl

But all I know is southern comfort

Out of plastic cups

Made a devil of a deal with another girl

We will see if it is worth it in about a month

693|cinnamon and cigarettes|"Neon pink wax, tonight's sleepless clay that I use to mold and sculpt with my fingertips like a child with bubblegum who no longer has anybody to tell me to spit it out or make sure I don't swallow or what the difference even is between right and wrong. pulling apart, a matching visual of a burning ember in my hands just hours ago, outside of the bar, as I flicked the rest of my cigarette onto the ground.

Now, a cold summer room attempts to hold me, before the world wakes, let me rest under a gray skylight disguised sunrise happening outside. drifting between last night and tomorrow in a bed of white blankets and sheets, draped walls of tapestries, the sound of the air conditioner and it's temperature gleam in lime green. the two digits, my only lines of certainty.

I can still smell the cigarettes and cinnamon gum, the kind I didn't play with because I have learned to behave, and because I felt like playing with your hair and your earlobes instead. I can still feel you pressed against me, burning and melting in the brightest of colors.

A bit of sugary sunshine

So stretched and pulled apart

But you pulled me back in with a kiss

The taste of saltwater on your mouth.  

&nbsp;

You are like taffy

So sticky and I am stuck 

Gripped by your sickly sweetness, 

soured by the taste of my rotting teeth.  

&nbsp;

You are like taffy

So small and seemingly safe

Except I swallowed you whole.

You are lodged near my heart,

and I cannot breathe.

Just now getting back into poetry; I'm not happy with this one but I don't know why. Any constructive criticism is awesome and appreciated!

    with your fleeting words

    to see you and feel the dull ache
    evolve into something so

 With such a longing to touch

those pretty little leaves,

699|But it doesn't rhyme|"Per a person who's partaken periodically in poetry...

I acknowledge alliteration approaches sultry...

&nbsp;

And a good haiku,

Without cheater on meter

seems exotic too,

&nbsp;


But if you get

upset

and fret

when you get yet,

I bet

again,

when they skip layout

&nbsp;

When they again chime,

""Why doesn't it rhyme?""

&nbsp;

Why hate? Pentameter remark aside,

Their trust, betrayed, is it now justified?

&nbsp;

Your prose knows no bounds, but the critics surround your lack of verse to them is terse, for dropping the syllabic match, you snatch from them their hope of hearing something dope, and that's the catch.

&nbsp;

For you have led them far, promised them a candybar,

but skipped the chocolate along the way, yet you still expect a payday;

for you were disobedient, by dropping out the primary ingredient,

and are justly reviled for your vice, of having relied on only spice!

Each step a million mile journey,
