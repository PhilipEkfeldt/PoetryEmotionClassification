You were a soft blur in everyday sight you left a sweet scent when you passed by me that masked your mysterious identity like a shadow impervious to light I only caught you with my fleeting eye your quaint stare fixed on the stars in the sky yet you were still a blur but you were quite the one person who fueled my delight You were a sharp smudge in those works of Art imperfect but perfection struck your heart I could see your passion in those fingers when they moved mere idleness broke apart I was moved by it and that was the start of why your blurred image that still lingers Now jolted my impassioned hands to paint The picture of your smile that was still faint You were a flash of lightning by the moon that I perhaps touched by its frantic tail and sent to your domain through a starry trail a dimension of shapeless lights that attune to the music released by your sweet voice like refreshing rain that calms the summer or spring’s smooth winds singing me to slumber and dream in nights where my love could rejoice You were a color within the dawn the morning Sun resplendent in your glance awakening a sound that was long gone Hope that chorus of God divinely done I could hear its phantom tunes within you dance I could see them scatter and cover the world The bright color of dawn ere me unfurled and you I could finally grasp perchance But you were a twilight in Paradise when sunset triumphs over the sunrise and the last color of the glorious morn quickly escapes and leaves the night forlorn A vestige of a masterpiece a ghost of a sentiment that filled me the most with much passion that I forgot the fear Of knowing one day you will disappear You are a shadow cast upon my road a darkness in my silent solitude when in lonely days I heave Sorrow’s load The bitter fate of Life I understood The every detail of your happy face Your loving ways I can never erase But the roads move always so I must too Maybe I will forget all about yo,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False

An Open Letter to the Girl in My Bed Remember when you asked if you could kiss me The light in my head went off We broke the barrier of friendship and for the first time in a long time I felt hope I guess my hopes were too high When I realized You were still hers Remember when you threw yourself at me The animal in my guts roared We broke through the door to my bedroom and for the first time in a long time I felt passion I guess there was too much passion Because I forgot to ask if You were still hers Remember when I put a stop to this My conscience betrayed my needs I broke off whatever you want to call this and for the first time in a long time I felt guilt I guess there was too much guilt Because I hated that You were still hers Remember when we pretended we never had that conversation My body overtook my mind We broke the promise to stay just friends and for the first time in a long time I didnt care I guess I didnt care too much Because I didnt bother asking if You were still hers I know it hasnt been long but Remember when you fell asleep in my bed Youre still sleeping there now I broke off alone to go and think and for the first time in a long time I feel content I guess I feel a little too content Because I finally know that You arent still hers But you arent mine either And maybe you never will be Maybe youre only using me but I need you to hear this I know Im nothing to you but You make me feel alive Even if its all a lie Previous Feedbac,True,False,True,False,False,False,False,True

This poem is nihilistic Unnecessarily conceited and artistic I’ll probably defeat and defile Any classic poetry style At least for a while Then I might drop the rhyme scheme altogether Time to get conversational Are my hamfisted attempts to be meta irritating Are hamfists too fleshy to break fourth walls Was that too transparent to be clever Does the fact I draw attention to my intention redeem its cleverness Is this even a poem anymore Will this get upvotes because its honest I don’t know and don’t care Because this poem is nihilistic But then why did I bother to write it Now that it has been about a day I can reveal the purpose of this poem A poem by uspitwitandwater inspired me to think about how poetry is received here I had a hypothesis that poems that are cliched or artistically but unjustifiably vague often do better than well crafted poetry I know in my experience that poems which I tried to be very honest or in ones that I spent longer amounts of time on were not received particularly well in terms of upvotes or volume of comments So to test this I wrote this poem in a couple of minutes and posted it The poem is not good It is inconsistent transparent and pointlessly abstract However it also got 26 upvotes in less than 24hrs and is by far my most successful poem on reddit I am not saying I am clever or that my other poems are masterpieces I simply wanted to point out that there is a trend here to praise certain kinds of poems that dont always deserve it while other absolute gems that I have read have been ignored Thankyou all for your replies and thanks uspitwitandwater for inspiring me to begin this little tes,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,True

Trigger Warning for some pretty explicit content I wrote this when I was still really grappling with some things about 2 years ago and Im finally almost feeling ready to share it with other humans Meant to be read aloud We ran across rooftops one night and kissed on the edge we stood above the world watching the people below as their lives passed before us – how easily they could see us skin exposed lips touching but no one ever looks up and somewhere between touching the sky and falling into your bed you said You’re fun And I don’t know what that means – In fact I have it on good authority that I’m not At age six AJ calls me goodytwoshoes because I’m afraid of getting caught out of class At eight I learn what it means to be a standin friend when my sister isn’t around to play and at thirteen Brittany’s trying to hand me pills that she found on the street and telling me that I’m not fun like my sister She would have taken them She’s not afraid I’m thirteen and I learn to stay inside because around here men drive around with their pants down and girls disappear in the middle of the day – found later weighing five pounds less from loss of dignity I’m thirteen and I’m always home because I think that I can somehow tether my sister and my mother to our apartment to me if I can cook and clean and keep everyone safe I’m thirteen and older guys come and go from our home like it’s theirs like my sister is theirs and it’s like their belts are always undone their faces always hungry and when I try to make them leave they burn me with their cigarettes bang on the doors and rattle the windows And they’re laughing and yelling and I’m standing in the middle of the room with my hands pressed against my ears counting the different ways to die I’m thirteen and my sister is missing My mother sits at home watching television and I’m searching the neighborhood with a girl and her grandmother She’s fourteen and we find her outside the house of the boy whose brand is still fresh on my thigh and she’s surrounded by men – Big men Tall men Older men Drinking and laughing men My sister falls on me and I realize that I can’t hear anything Their faces all blurred into one giant portrait of the bad things that happen to little girls when they get caught and someone needs to remind me to walk She’s fourteen and describing the things that he made her do to his dick She’s fourteen and her eyes are rolling back into her head She’s fourteen and the EMTs have to put her on a stretcher because she can’t stand and somewhere in the background my mother is stopping her boyfriend from going over there to kill someone and maybe she’s right and maybe I’m the one who’s crazy but what kind of mother says No Don’t hurt the man who raped my baby My kind of mother protects rapists My kind of mother always puts the man first And my kind of mother has plenty of experience because for years she shielded my father from view hovering above us like a dark cloud while he raped me again and again My kind of mother sends children out alone into a world where it’s too dangerous to borrow sugar from your neighbor and when we come back bruised and broken she tells us to sit down and shut up or she’ll give us something to cry about For my kind of mother this is just another thing she has to deal with And when at sixteen I told her that Eric had molested me my kind of mother invited him to stay in our home and told him he was like a son to her So I learned to say yes when I’m scared and violence is the only other answer to say yes when they need me when they want me when I have to to say yes least of all when I want to When you say I’m fun I don’t know what you mean but I hope it means you like me that I pleased you I hope it means I’m safe but if you don’t call me tomorrow or next week – If you don’t call me again that’s okay because somewhere inside me I’m still just afraid of the bad things that happen to little girls when they get caugh,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False

to all the boys that have I have loved 1 thank you 2 I am sorry 3 I won’t forget C when ‘private numbers’ brought us together I did not know that I would fall in love with the image of what we could have been but we were only thirteen we were not strong enough to carry an emotion much older than us It fucked us both up even now seeing you makes my knees week I’d do anything to go back to twenty twelve I think every once in awhile I still wonder when I stumbled upon you W everyone saw it coming except for you and I you knew the truth but loved me anyways I gave you all of my firsts and you tried to teach me about love but how can I love you when I didn’t love myself I was never content but it was not your fault you deserved much more than my half heart I’ll never stop being sorry I know from the start R we were just a pitstop along the way a shoulder to cry on and an ear to listen I’m not really sure if I loved you but I can still remember what hope and redemption tasted like but we never loved each other at the same time the push and pull became tiring and alcohol was easier to consume I do not know a goodbye more beautiful I dropped everything for us H because I believed we were soulmates and your mother started calling me ‘daughter’ so I finally let you in and you started breaking promises the resentment turned me numb but you were the happiest I’ve ever been our future together was just not worth the struggle of pretending that we could read each others minds but don’t worry we’ll reunite every moonlight at 1111pm F you picked me out of the best and took me home and I wanted to give you everything but you were trying to build a kingdom from ruins of course it was bound to collapse you made me feel so whole and I think happiness is a beautiful look on the both of us I’ve never let anyone in so easily but now I understand why I hadn’t and I really should have met you first because then maybe you can be the only man I’ve ever love,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,True
