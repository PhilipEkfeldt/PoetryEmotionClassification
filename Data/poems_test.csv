Tap tap flick 602 am eyes crusted dry mouth the cavern in my chest grows larger as the light saturates the bedroom and reflects a tired face on a smudged black screen Tap tap flick I dont know you Caitlin32 but your life is an exhibition and Im just a greedy voyeur trying to fill a giant cavity with your perfect pastiche of placid domesticity Tap tap flick Gold watches invisalign smiles your curated lifestyle content beams at me like a radio transmitter set to crippling self loathing with the reverb of an envious pout Tap tap flick Drag myself out of bed its time to feed the bullshit machine with artfully contoured cheeks and an empty family posed with tepid day old Acai bowls God damnit Jeffery I dont care if youre tired you need to SMILE for the likes Tap tap clic,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0
A heartbeat is like a neverending stampede of buffalo hooves crushing sandstone into the ground fur knotted necks coated with a thick film of sweat they run faster when there’s danger Sometimes I hate looking at you because your eyes are unknown minerals impossible to grasp set perfectly in the museum of your face behind oversized dark frames I wish I wasn’t above burglary My buffalo are tired and they’re running straight from the burning coals of hell into your arms and I can’t seem to figure out if they’re tearing their hair out with their teeth or getting a cool drink of water I’m struggling to accept that the marble of your skin might have red veins of granite next time I hold you but I’ve never actually gotten the chance to hold you so I call myself a failure and try to shoot my ghosts in the head I’ve been thinking about you during long car rides the roadkill and the pines sliding from my rearview mirror into the horizon I hope you think about me sometimes I wonder if I’ll kiss you our lips soaked with each other we’re dripping like peach juice down the maroon walls of the passion we’ve created Will you feel anything with my fingers on your waist I’m loading up a shotgun shells copper and iron and plastic staring at my herd I can’t help but question if the saying kill your darlings rings true so I’m pacing pondering folding into myself asking the world to send a sign because I’m awfully lost and could really use a get out of my own fucking head car,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0

Hi Im Sam I post poems for my pen pal Bill who is incarcerated and does not have Internet access I have posted some of his work in the past The poems are all his and I have nothing to do with their content the feedback however is from me as it would take weeks for Bill to receive a poem from here and send his feedback to me Feedback Christmas Prison ‘Twas the night before Christmas And all through the halls The guards dragged their sticks Across the doors and the walls Then an hour before Christmas Eleven to be exact The Count was in progress There was a flashlight attack They bang our beds to startle us awake Telling us to uncover it’s important to make The guards be aware you are breathing still His only invasion is to know if you are well Their footfalls are noisy with their keys aclang Their voices are loud like bells with a bang The department keeps us awake with fluorescent lights Something old St Nick would be startled with fright And then there are the searches throughout the day It’s Christmas again the guards get to play They toss all our presents our lives completely undone So they can get double time and have some fun Christmas isn’t Christmas here it’s just another day No lights no trees no holiday cheer no children at play Men just wake up to another day lost Surrounded by jailers and guards that think they’re the boss Then there are the phone calls From kids in ecstasy When are you coming home daddy To celebrate and be with me I just sit here tears rolling down my face Saying soon soon remember to set me a place Although in the back of my mind I have many years to fill To give to the state to repay the till Don’t get me wrong we all make mistakes We run through stop signs we forget to brake And then there are many here that have done much worse They have hijacked our lives and killed our thirst There are millions of men and women that upon this Christmas day They languish in the prisons sleeping their lives away We should all remember that we could be there too One wrong decision we make the action we take our freedom could be through I am one among you this lesson still rings true With all the pain suffering and time I still have to do But I believe in Christmas its forgiving qualities That gives a man a second chance to live with family All I can say is keep your life mistake free You don’t want to go to prison or to be a casualty This never was a good place for people to be At Christmas time or any time a place without a tre,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
I can still smell the organic dark roast Trader Joes coffee my best friends stepmom would brew every morning It was bitter and strong and dark and rich And she told us she wished she had married A man who was more like her coffee Never too sweet because that always fades Marry for money at least it will last she said as we pulled away from the big house that she hated While she wore a big shiny ring that confirmed that her husband didnt listen when she told him what she learned about blood diamonds in that documentary she watched alone I never could tell when people were lying But she couldnt even fool me even the selfobsessed fifteenyearold version of me noticed if only then the pile she balanced Haphazardly on her shoulders of broken marriage fragments and I realized That finding real love in this world was going to be very hard but I wanted to shake her to call out her lies and jump out of the new SUV with the automatic doors and DVD player that I knew she wished was smaller and conserved gas and I wonder if I should have told her she didnt have anyone fooled 1 ,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0
I remembered the time I wanted to kill myself I’m in the top floor of the library Ocean view I see ledge that I looked down from to think about whether or not the fall would kill me I imagined the wind rushing my face the temporary regret that I would feel after jumping wishing that I had not done it in the first place Then the sudden thud and nonexistence Just cut to black like the Sopranos It’s weird to think someone could come to the conclusion that the best option or a viable option would be to kill oneself Two here already kicked the bucket What did they think Why would something of this world something likely material or a relationship that has only existed in this small blip of the timeline of the universe be even worthy enough to make one consider going against millions of years of evolution The black crows in the pale blue sky contrast They flow and twirl in the air like leaves in the wind The birds are going crazy Me to,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0

My grandfather’s clock died in much the same way as he did As the years passed its gears began to slow and its voice grew softer I believe it began to count as it ticked away its own remaining seconds It began to forget forget how to tell time forget how to speak forget that we were there watching listening always hoping for one more toll of its weary voice When it expired its hands were clasped together somewhere between the seven and eight There was little in the way of visual cues to signify its passing It looked the same in death as it had in life its wooden body was strong and weathered But the air no longer hummed as it used to My grandfather’s clock died before I could tell time It died before I could appreciate its monotonous tick its hourly drone I hear it was really something special they don’t make clocks like that anymor,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1

Have you ever tried to dig into your mind To sift and root through the clutter accrued To cut and burn all which you have derived To wade through the shit to save those precious jewels ‘Tis an arduous task not many can bear To look themselves deeper through their own eye To tread through the reflection one should beware For you are the doctor with the best tools to pry They say it changes one reforms them anew An archaic practice with a purpose most just To probe the minds eye and realign the sinew Until there’s nothing left but the reflection of a husk But was the atrocity worth it to quiet the demand A catharsis in killing but your soul be damned Links Author Note for those of you picky about punctuation Im actually not sure if I should end the first stanza at jewels with a period or a question mark Clarification would be greatly appreciate,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0
We call the sun Beautiful She is a life giver The warmest eye to look upon me She will burn you Down to bone Then to nothing We call the sun Radiant An unmerciful mother We bask in her beauty too long and become hephaestus Love me mother with my wounds weeping Warm me until my bones crack and splinter My muscle and blood become dust Love me how I know to be loved With pain With hunger Love me mother as the cat loves the bird Until you catch me And consume me Love me so completely that there is nothing left We call the sun Beautiful And maybe beauty is as the saying goes pain Or Maybe the sun is God Because I have tried to see her And I always feel my eyes burning Hot in their sockets 1 ,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0
If March brings life then November is the dying time Bare skeletons masquerade as trees and birds sit silent As grief flaps widewinged to perch across your back We share glances like children trading secrets Gathered like pagans around a standing stone One for sorrow and us in black a single shadow A raised hand against the weak sun your veil a shadow As dirt falls onto polished wood and keeps time Words come from you slower than blood from a stone My only consolation is this your arm against mine isnt silent Holding hands hidden by your coat sleeves your worst kept secrets Rest on my tongue like wafer like ash like things I cant give back Home is a place you left behind afraid to look back In case you saw someone at the window a shadow Heres a list of things you cant keep wishes secrets People wild birds They all escape you in time The wooden floors went petrified and groaning pipes went silent The rooms we walked were cold our pale bare feet on stone Im looking at window panes with hands empty for a stone But you turn away and I come to lay my head on your back Arms across your stomach and your heartbeat isnt silent But the early setting sun makes your face a shadow And you leave me in the garden to be alone for a time Keeping your own council keeping your own secrets Waiting I count blackbirds on the powerline seven for secrets That we cant even tell ourselves or Medusa with a mirror we turn to stone Someone told me once well meaning These things take time I had two choices I dropped my fist and turned my back A bird wings across the sky like a silky shadow I make a wish but keep it on my tongue sweet and silent The man they laid in the ground today had sat statuesilent When you first grabbed my hand fierce like you were screaming secrets Anger clawed across his face like a shadow And when he shook his head he turned your beating heart to stone But when we went out the garden gate like Lots wife I looked back With salt across my face and he had watched us walk away for the longest time Dont let us wait drawn silent as we run out of time Each of us refusing to give our secrets back Everything we love becomes a shadow when they put us under ston,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0

Drunk on a Monday I feel the sneer the inevitable curl of the lip and the staccato laugh that burns like the vodka in my sprite bottle Exchanged glances rolled eyes and I laugh too but it pitches and rolls stumbles under the weight of heedless insincerity drunk on a Monday and I cant be bothered to explain myself to the silence To the scratching of pencils on paper and the tapping of fingers on keys I harmonize my sips to the melody while a symphony of sympathy fills my ears drunk on a monday because tonight I need to call a tap out on this body and theres two ways out of here one looks like a bottle and forgetting the other is a razorblade and its kiss Ive tottered my way down both avenues before but Im getting tired of the scars drunk on a monday I lie in a bed next to my best friend and in the darkness I open my mouth pour out the secrets I cant stomach when Im sober but Im drunk and its Monday so he asks can we talk about this tomorrow and we both know hes asking for us to never talk about this again I swallow the truth and it turns my stomach worse than any liquor ever has I wish that a finger in my throat could expel it just as quickl,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1

It’s 300am and I should have gone to sleep 3 and a half hours ago but instead I’m talking to this guy This guy with dead green eyes and slicked back hair with straight teeth and long legs He gets it At least I think he does maybe I just want him to He’s a sweet kisser when he’s sober and leaves bruises on my thighs after a couple beers I don’t mind he’s good company and doesn’t care that I’m hurting because he doesn’t care about much and I don’t want to care about anything at all But when we’re in his bed and he turns away from me instead of sleeping I connect the freckles on his back creating constellations out of tiny brown birthmarks He is beautiful and as I trace his skin with my fingers I feel a little more at home more than I have in a long time But then he sits up and reminds me that he doesn’t care and I remember that I don’t care either I walk home fighting the crisp autumn air and make myself toast in an empty kitchen and hit my head on an open cupboard and all I can see are star,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1
My brother and I carefully place pennies on the rails behind my greatgrandmothers house We wait for a coal train to squish them Its fun until I realize we can’t buy anything with flat disks of zinc Are you able to hit the breaks Or do you need me to put my heart out like a new penny How many people have pulled themselves to pieces by the tracks Were they hoping like me that their flattened bodies might become something useful I’m holding your head as feel you die It’s so fast the empty space where your soul had been blows through my hair Or maybe it’s been a season A syringe turns into a dead leaf and slowly falls out of your fingers Your lips become a frozen lake I’m shivering naked screaming your name into a blizzard A paramedic tells me you’re lucky but I can’t hear her over the wind from a train we can’t stop Edited This is the first poem Ive written in a decade Writing is helping me heal so reviews comments and suggestions would be super appreciate,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0

He picks up the pennies everywhere he goes Pieces of bigger things the fragments of the whole There never was a miracle too small to behold and so he kept every one and every one made him bowed The others all around him seemed happy in their role but he knew only backache toil and toll He carried his burden as vast as he old Too large to conceal he never let it go He slept on coin pillows the color of mold and defended his treasure with a vigor so bold that ten men together should endeavor to hold One day while counting the man in his home heard a noise from the ceiling that sounded of groan He dashed for his pennies as groan grew to moan and was crushed under rains of money he owe,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0

An Open Letter to the Girl in My Bed Remember when you asked if you could kiss me The light in my head went off We broke the barrier of friendship and for the first time in a long time I felt hope I guess my hopes were too high When I realized You were still hers Remember when you threw yourself at me The animal in my guts roared We broke through the door to my bedroom and for the first time in a long time I felt passion I guess there was too much passion Because I forgot to ask if You were still hers Remember when I put a stop to this My conscience betrayed my needs I broke off whatever you want to call this and for the first time in a long time I felt guilt I guess there was too much guilt Because I hated that You were still hers Remember when we pretended we never had that conversation My body overtook my mind We broke the promise to stay just friends and for the first time in a long time I didnt care I guess I didnt care too much Because I didnt bother asking if You were still hers I know it hasnt been long but Remember when you fell asleep in my bed Youre still sleeping there now I broke off alone to go and think and for the first time in a long time I feel content I guess I feel a little too content Because I finally know that You arent still hers But you arent mine either And maybe you never will be Maybe youre only using me but I need you to hear this I know Im nothing to you but You make me feel alive Even if its all a lie Previous Feedbac,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1

A Portrait of the ManicDepressive as a Young Man This is the worst ginger ale Ive had in my life I said to the white walls and fluorescent lights A recordsetting breakdown achieving the impossible Shooting for the moon and landing in the hospital Picking at the bracelet that bore my name and 21M Waiting for a mediocre meal that never even came Noticing the dirt and grime covering the floors I suddenly felt an irreversible shame The shame of my roommate escorting me to the psych center Making sure I didnt walk into oncoming traffic The shame of having to explain to my parents that every girl I ever loved has turned out to be an addict The shame of wanting to fuck the therapist because sex is the only thing that makes me feel anymore The shame The shame the shame of it all tore me to bits and the next hours blurred Forms Urine samples Blood tests Questionnaires Diagnoses Discharge Words I remembered my fathers words as I put on my sweater He said Son sometimes life doesnt get any better Now its time once again to get it all back in order Even though heartbreak is waiting just around the corner The moment you confided in me my beautiful friend The truth broke me in half and now it has to end And as I sit in my room with the indigo walls The lights are off and this ginger ale tastes like nothing at all Previous feedbac,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1

I was 22 when we first met Raw skin still tingling where I had ripped off the bandaid Of a former lover’s embrace You were 31 Convinced I was the healing tonic To finally quell that fiery ache burning like bile in your throat I was unsure skeptical of your certainty But there was solace in your closeness As I drank you in with tiny sips From a sterile plastic cup With time your touch became a familiar ointment against my old bruises Your words became soft cotton And your tongue sterilized my open cuts That still refuse to heal We have leaned against each other these five years Our entanglement a crutch for limping strides An affectionate anesthetic numbing already dulled pains But my body is not a tonic Or a bandage Or a salve I am not a pill to be swallowed with patient gulps I cannot heal you This was only temporary relief A palliative mistaken for a cure A comforting togetherness that has grown into dependency And as I feel myself liquidated into a syrup Depleting with each of your measured doses I long for the solidity of solitude Tend to your wounds lover And I’ll tend to mine Your restoration cannot be found here Your remedy lies behind someone else’s flesh Feedbac,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0
The first month I visited Larry every Friday We spent those cool fall nights with the heat on in his daughter’s living room watching jeopardy His shrunken body sunk into an oversized recliner I sat next to him on the couch I remember the wisp of white hair on his head That first month he didn’t say much Larry didn’t really care for jeopardy or television or anything really he said Except for Jesus So one Friday night I turned off the TV and we listened to Hallelujah Buckley’s voice belting from an electronic speaker about broken love and holy doves and Larry nodded his head Then he looked over at me with pale blue eyes and told me secrets Don’t be one thing one time and something else the next be steadfast in your walk and in your life Even though the world may reject you and you may be mocked and scorned yet it will be worth it all Larry told me that his daughter’s husband turned the TV up too loud Larry told me he never once had taken a vitamin Larry told me he loved the Lord Larry told me he felt alone Larry told me Sometimes we get so busy with the little cares of our lives that we don’t really know people the way we should especially family It’s up to us to cultivate relationships but we’re often too busy with our own little cares Larry usually finished his thoughts with but I don’t know I don’t know I went to see Larry the day before he died I held a straw to his lips as he swallowed a few final drips of ice water His daughter told me that he was close He took my hand and looked into my eyes Something pulled me in to those pools of blue and I melted An invisible line held us as I saw him fade slowly into eternity Hallelujah And then he said One glimpse of his dear face and all sorrows erase He said something else but I didn’t write it down I wish I had written it down Im a hospice volunteer and this is based on one of my experiences with a patient The title contains a few pieces of information from the sheet we get Name has been changed for confidentiality as well as a couple of minor details Larry was my first homecare case meaning that I didn’t visit him in hospital I visited him at his daughter’s house and we would just hang out and eat ice cream listen to music or read the Bible together I spent most every Friday night last fall hanging out with him He was a cool guy RIP Larr,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1

Circles and Squares Haley Walker I live in a world full of circles and squares And most of them live without fret Like slinkies that glide down most any old stairs Theyre happy with what they can get But stumble I do and fall flat on my side To waddle across that big gaping divide Because as you see I was born as a square And for that Im sadly upset I live in a world full of circles and squares That think that theres nothing between Though circles and squares have so much that they share They always entirely lean I round out my corners and practise to roll I pad up my edges and wall up my soul Though my friends assure me it feels so unfair Inside to myself I feel mean I live in a world full of circles and squares The heart of mine just wouldnt budge I live with the fear that the shapes would all stare And grimace or silently judge One day Im just fine but another Im not My mind is inflamed it aches shot after shot A circular square cant belong anywhere When its selfesteem turns to sludge Im truly a circle but look like a square My friends all converse through my phone Although my support is dispersed everywhere I feel Im completely alone To laugh at my face Youre just nonsense newfangled The powers that be say Im legally angled If only I knew this I grudge in my prayer Much sooner as I curse my bones I live in a world full of circles and squares A world where its so hard to care Feedbac,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0

Other people give their hearts to a lover I gave you the freckle on my collarbone You claimed it as yours one day while we lay tangled in each other and the sunbeams and in the ghosts of other women Staving off the day and exploring all the centimeters of flesh that anchored us to the mattress you danced your fingertips over the parts of me that I ached to keep concealed You called it your Aluniţă Feminine noun again Like all the words that hold us to our womanhood by the tips of sharpened tongues So I carved her out with a butter knife and served her to you on that platter with mangoes and beer bread and twobit poetry All I asked in return was that spot just above the curve of your left ankle and some chewing gum to mend the chink in my armor in the empty space where my freckle used to be Sometimes nowadays when I look in the mirror I lament the bareness of my collarbone and I become nostalgic for the time before you loved her when my skin was my own to call by name But then I turn to barter away that gap that sits between my two front teeth to the woman with the voice that has all the richness of mosscovered bark in a rainstorm And I think in wonder at the lovers with only hearts to giv,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0
