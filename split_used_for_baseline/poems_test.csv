Suffocate individuality Under a pillow with leftover mascara From the night before I never wore adidas as a fashion statement Couldn’t ever afford the cost Of a dentist appointment Never got a flower I wouldn’t tear apart For the lady packing groceries At the closest quickie mart Look me in the eyes And tell me you don’t see beauty In the way I giggle compliments Out crookedly Like a pair of mismatched socks that go perfectly together Not a day goes by that I don’t think about imperfection The ideal body instead an empty box Wrapped with silk ribbon and red velvet paper Wondering why this maker in the sky Decided to put a tooth on the top shelf Of my smile Why I look at beauty standards like limbo But the bar is skimming the floor and everyone is just going lower and lower And I was the only one who wanted to step over it Why when I meet someone my toes curl And my heart hurls A million reasons why someone could love them I am not a neck breaker Just a hand shaker I won’t knock the wind out of you But I’ll give you my jacket I’ll give you my last fruit and leave myself With an empty basket I don’t turn heads I twist minds Heart strings in my hands Drip like watermelon rinds Because I make you feel inside It’s low tide but the waves are rising Your scared of genuine but it’s sweet like icing I’m enticing but on the inside where it counts I’m the type of person you can’t live without Because of the words that are formed by my mouth A plethora of color and A touch of grey A sunset after the longest day Open mind molded with clay But crafted with fingertips so delicate You wouldn’t think that lily pads could float Raise a toast to the strangers on the street Say kind things to every person you meet Because they are me They are us Unconventional at best Giving whatever I can to the rest But I can only send you home with this The beauty from your heart Is an eternity of bliss,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1
Sat slumped back curled on curtain tails Glass stained with the pitter patter of a night unslept Dew drips from window and down each cheek Every week spent waiting for that wakeup glancing at eyes dancing in the sunrise Every day spent peering at a fish hook the curl of lips cast across her face held tight with bated breath Every minute spent here by the wall and the window unravelling thoughts of a life unlived and tying them to the rafter Youd go back for mere second,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0

Note My very best friend challenged me to write a sestina For the life of me I couldnt do it So I wrote a poem about why I WAS NOT going to write oneWe had a great laugh over it and I finally managed to churn out a sestina2 years later I DONT want to write a sestina Ive much better things I can do Like picking my nose in the mirror Or counting my steps to the loo But Marcus insists I should write one A simple sestina says he Just something to give you a challenge Expand your creativity So I actually started to write one I took out my pencil and pad And thats when it suddenly hit me I knew I had almost been had Hes entered a poetry contest Hes done this before I surmise Hes going to use my sestina And with it hell win the first prize Hes trying to steal all my wisdom And suck all the skills from my brain Hes going to pilfer my talents And use them for illgotten gains Hell win a gazillion of dollars Hell gain lots of fortune and fame And when he receives all his honors He wont even mention my name HIS name will be plastered in neon His face on a webpage will be Hell make like the Frito Bandido Hell run off to Europe Sí Sí My best friend is plotting against me Our friendship is going to wane For a few fleeting moments of glory A labor of love down the drain Well THATS why Im NOT gonna write one Oh Yeah Mr Sneaky Youll see Youre NOT gonna get a sestina At least you wont get it from Me,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0
This one is for the children whose parents pay my mother to listen to their kids talk for an hour or so each week You get more of my mother in one session than I have received in twenty years Did you know that having my mother listen to your feelings for an hour each week is a gift that I never recieved Did you know that when I was having issues my mother didnt ask me how I felt or ask me to talk to her about what I was going through no Her reaction was to send me to some stranger a student from her school to practice on me for a discounted price And now she is getting paid to care about you Which leads me to wonder that maybe if I had paid for her time maybe my mother would have listened to me too To the children who get more attention from my mother than I ever dared ask for where were you during the divorce that almost happened Because I was there feeling every heartache with you Mom Crying at a forever tainted Dairy Queen that you brought me to trying to soften the harsh blow of the ugly word divorce with a guilty offering of ice cream I brought that Blizzard home with me uneaten and after weeks threw it in the trash yet the cold lingered in my heart and in our house for years To the children who see my mother every week Where were you when my mother was sad Because I was always there and Mom You were always sad And I always listened to you So why couldn’t you just listen to me Mom You once told me you door was always open but it was only open on your terms Only if I acted like the perfect daughter that I never managed to be Your door was shut to the real me To the children whose parents pay my mother to listen to their kids feelings for an hour or so every week I wonder do your parents listen to you,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

The days are mainly gray in May and those days I mainly feel this way As I ponder the rain and the plains of Spain to dull the pain of this mental plane No drive to work or urge to play until the dark clouds fade away And with them from my shoulders take the burdens that most heavily weigh Allowing the sun to shine it’s light and clear the fog behind my eyes Giving way to take safe flight down my foreseen path once it dries For now though I must sit and wait using this time as a needed break To take count of what is most at stake and which things of mine I must forsake Though doing so may cause some pain and my face to turn wet from facing the rain But it must be done and done this way All in the hopes that there will come a day where the sun is bright and there to stay And on that day I’ll give thanks to May for those days that were mainly gray,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0

The sun lightly kisses my skin My face red blushing from all the attention The matching shadow of our eyelashes Fall on our cheeks long like spiders He licks his salty lips Our feet dangling over a graveyard Of sunflowers that will never be I examine the cracks in his worn leather mitt As if I were memorizing each line of his calloused hands The wind murmurs secrets into our ears He tells me everything I am Everything I will be And I cocoon myself in every word,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0

One day I met upon my way A lovely fox who pranced and played In quiet awe I ceased my stride She stopped as well but did not hide Her eyes I held and hers did mine So saw the fox and I I dared not move I kept quite still And so it was with no small thrill She neared to me arm’s length or less And did not run from my caress Yet she still trembled at my touch So met the fox and I Our bond thus made she led me now I watched her play intrigued at how In little things she took delight Like flowers trees and other sights She taught me much about the world So walked the fox and I As we progressed along the path My stoic self began to laugh To watch how charming how carefree That lovely creature could now be It moved me deep within in my breast So went the fox and I Such simple splendour we then felt As boy and fox on hilltop knelt And watched the world for some short while Repose devoid of care nor trial A quiet place where time stood still So knelt the fox and I When came the time to leave again I bade the lovely fox remain For my path led through the unknown A journey safest made alone I could not bear her come to harm So stood the fox and I I promise fox youll walk with me For in our time I came to see That kindred souls will oft ensure Their paths will intertwine once more It wont be long I promise dear So loved the fox and I Do you ever write poetry that is so deeply intertwined with personal emotional experience that you really dont care if anyone else in the world gets it This is one of those Backstory I spent years taking LSD and other psychedelics and writing under the influence more as an experiment than anything else I have no interest in publishing and loathe the idea of blogging so I finally swallowed enough courage to share some of the collection here on Reddit becausewhy the hell not I have modified my disclaimer from the other submissions from Its probably shit to Its all bullshit I think that more aptly describes my position on my work,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0

The armrest is mine or should be Middle seat and all But still his sleeve violates me Absent any breeze it wanly kisses then Obscenely tongues my bare arm as if Steered by a poltergeist malicious invisible We are fellow captives here Seven miles above the Rockies Securely stowed in a fastness of petroleum byproducts But still he is my enemy I should have paid for first class I should have worn longer sleeves Dimly I sense the heat from his elbow A corona of pallid warmth Nudging me with each intake of breath Which he insists on executing With great regularity and volume It has been five hundred and sixtythree days Since the last heat of another’s touch Faded from the small of my back The blood long since having rushed back in To fill the pale whorls and crescents Left by teeth and hands a fingerprint Writ large on arms and back and chest And I think about sexual frustration How once it was thought to animate the geists That plied their antics on the frigid or hysterical Prying open the clenched Victorian fist of propriety By hurling toys and dishes knocking picture frames from the wall With chilly fingers seeking warmth that still lingered On those items marked by love This playful ghost seeks not to trouble my sleep But to pierce the spherical mask of oneway glass That holds in the rare and fragile gasses That are the only air I know that allow me To dive these deep and social seas It knows I long to taste other atmospheres With no pane between us Fogged by my own stale breath For a moment I lean into the airspace Of my seatmate faint with the afterimage Of good soap and aftershave clean citrus sandalwood He stirs in his sleep his arm resting gently against mine For a moment before he pulls away smiling an apology He does not see my smile in return Nor notice how I slow my breathing to match his As he settles back into the deep rhythm of inhaleexhale That I have come to know so well in our time together,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0

We ran across rooftops one night and kissed on the edge we stood above the world watching the people below as their lives passed before us – how easily they could see us skin exposed lips touching but no one ever looks up and somewhere between touching the sky and falling into your bed you said You’re fun And I don’t know what that means – In fact I have it on good authority that I’m not At age six AJ calls me goodytwoshoes because I’m afraid of getting caught out of class At eight I learn what it means to be a standin friend when my sister isn’t around to play and at thirteen Brittany’s trying to hand me pills that she found on the street and telling me that I’m not fun like my sister She would have taken them She’s not afraid I’m thirteen and I learn to stay inside because around here men drive around with their pants down and girls disappear in the middle of the day – found later weighing five pounds less from loss of dignity I’m thirteen and I’m always home because I think that I can somehow tether my sister and my mother to our apartment to me if I can cook and clean and keep everyone safe I’m thirteen and older guys come and go from our home like it’s theirs like my sister is theirs and it’s like their belts are always undone their faces always hungry and when I try to make them leave they burn me with their cigarettes bang on the doors and rattle the windows And they’re laughing and yelling and I’m standing in the middle of the room with my hands pressed against my ears counting the different ways to die I’m thirteen and my sister is missing My mother sits at home watching television and I’m searching the neighborhood with a girl and her grandmother She’s fourteen and we find her outside the house of the boy whose brand is still fresh on my thigh and she’s surrounded by men – Big men Tall men Older men Drinking and laughing men My sister falls on me and I realize that I can’t hear anything Their faces all blurred into one giant portrait of the bad things that happen to little girls when they get caught and someone needs to remind me to walk She’s fourteen and describing the things that he made her do to his dick She’s fourteen and her eyes are rolling back into her head She’s fourteen and the EMTs have to put her on a stretcher because she can’t stand and somewhere in the background my mother is stopping her boyfriend from going over there to kill someone and maybe she’s right and maybe I’m the one who’s crazy but what kind of mother says No Don’t hurt the man who raped my baby My kind of mother protects rapists My kind of mother always puts the man first And my kind of mother has plenty of experience because for years she shielded my father from view hovering above us like a dark cloud while he raped me again and again My kind of mother sends children out alone into a world where it’s too dangerous to borrow sugar from your neighbor and when we come back bruised and broken she tells us to sit down and shut up or she’ll give us something to cry about For my kind of mother this is just another thing she has to deal with And when at sixteen I told her that Eric had molested me my kind of mother invited him to stay in our home and told him he was like a son to her So I learned to say yes when I’m scared and violence is the only other answer to say yes when they need me when they want me when I have to to say yes least of all when I want to When you say I’m fun I don’t know what you mean but I hope it means you like me that I pleased you I hope it means I’m safe but if you don’t call me tomorrow or next week – If you don’t call me again that’s okay because somewhere inside me I’m still just afraid of the bad things that happen to little girls when they get caught,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0

Back at the honking conga line Mexican side of the border after building houses for five days We buy churros from a vendor and talk about Jesus An engine revs A 250sized truck catapults over the top of a twentyfoot dirt ramp to our right Crunching steel and screaming Someone warns us of what we’ll see if we look I can’t resist The driver is shaken but intact still seated in the cab talking to cops through a broken window Meanwhile the cart vendor he struck gushes blood from a head wound while he flops in a doctors’ arms seizing on a makeshift bed over potholed asphalt Whenever I see a murder of crows flying overhead I wonder what theyre trying to escape Starving family man steals bread we understand even if we can’t condone it After all wouldnt the thief rather be anything else if there were any other way I wonder what the man the driver hit had planned to do today Maybe one of the homes we built was for him I wonder if his wife is sitting at the table right now wondering if his souvenir stall was just a little extra busy today Stirring a pot of beans and rice heated on an open fire bought with a piece of their 125 a month My community loved to lament that fact that such a hardworking and honorable people had so little Build houses share the Good News Do the Lord’s work They also loved to call undocumented immigrants illegals Were seated in a cargo van eating churros heading back toward hot showers and clean running water Praising God that we saved these peoples souls Somewhere back in Tijuana a desperate mother scoops rainwater from a barrel with a dead rat at the bottom and hopes that the cartel moves slower in the dark,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0

Alone under the burning embers of the dark heavens I ask the clouds whether it is appropriate to pray The palm trees drift The goldenbacked insects converse I beg for a response A beetle floats in a glass of rosé What is the value of life without death He ponders What is the race without the finish line the wave without the shore to crash upon A rotting chrysanthemum petal lies in a passed friend’s throat Does death feel better than even the greatest pleasures of life Two hotel guests stop in front of a flower One wears red heels and talks about her distaste of instrumental only music The other smokes a long cigar and wears a wrinkled suit They pull on a petal and it crumbles like bonedust in a coffin There is beauty within the sky The stars choose not to show themselves tonight The mollusks bask like sealions on the shore They pull a high tide blanket over them and slip into the ocean I turn to the beetle and ask him what immortality would look like He tells me to look at the works of the greats Hemingway and Li Bai Forever is only achievable through memories and influence I tell him that words and ideas do not adapt to the ebb and flow of time The peeling bark of an oak tree chimes in If the dead are watching do they see our mistakes I tell the oak that when I look at a good friend of mine his eyes are sad They are no longer green they lost their light coloring after he hit puberty I am often overcome with the realization that his mother will not be able to attend his wedding There was nothing else to be said so I packed up my things The beetle asked me to meet him in the next stage one day I nodded and smiled The human mind is a problem solving machine so it frustrates me to know that he will have answers much sooner than I,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1

The morning began with coffee and toast And browsing the web for news The world was a veritable hotbed it seemed Of geopolitical feud An emptiness sat at the table beside him Silently calling his name A hole in the shape of a redheaded woman Who Jesus had taken away He put on his shoes and buttoned his buttons And scratched at his labrador’s ear Then lowered his head and stepped into winter That Thursday of his forty third year,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1

I remember when the world had more vivid colors than it does now When my mother was twice as tall as I was When kickball lasted until the streetlights came on or until someone ran into the tree that we used as home plate and no one could talk them out of going home Sometimes we would come home to sticky buns Warm bread and sticky glaze made for a mapleflavored mess spread across the face and hands of four children ALL dirt sticks to children who have just eaten sticky buns Dirt or not I remember the way we looked forward to them I also remember the look on my mothers face every time she made them as if burdened by a weight that children were not aware of Many years later I know how theyre made A simple recipe made for childrens taste premade biscuits from the cans that explode cooked until golden then drizzled with maple syrup and left to bake for just a few more minutes The perfect blast of sugar for energywasting children Such a simple recipe was surely born in desperation In retrospect I know that look upon my mothers face as pain once in lieu of dinner she poured syrup over biscuits To cook the only food we had Every time we called for sticky buns she was reminded of our poverty Yet still she obliged cooking up sticky buns for her kids who knew not what poverty meant yet were formed under its rule with sticky hands and dirty faces,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0

You were The storm clouds In the eyes That stared Back At me The lonely soul I heard Beneath the happy voice Talking with friends Rambling on about Exotic birds and Heartbreak And the past I heard you Searching for company Asking me if I wanted to Sit and just Talk Without our friends Just the two of us You were The loneliness That reached for me And tugged on my sleeve Because you were alone And it was dark And you wanted me To be the waypoint The strength That pushed on While you fell in Behind my confidence You were The emptiness That pressed on When I couldn’t be there You were The abyss That sought to fill the void With just Anyone You were the melancholy That Tore down All the beauty in your life And ate away at what was And still Couldn’t stomach The reality you tried to force on yourself Sometimes I wonder If you’re still trying to be The lie That you tell yourself Or if you just Look at every woman’s face And still see me Or if you try to sleep But you still hear my voice in the silence Maybe Not Anymore But maybe You are The carnations That still live By the morning sun On my kitchen table I only wrote this poem just for therapeutic reasons I never intended it to be a masterpiece or anything as I didn’t even try to come up with a rhyme scheme or anything too clever so this is completely free form However I still feel like sharing it and seeing how people interpret the expression I tried to convey in the stuff I write I realize it’s not my best but it’s still nice to get the feelings out and still get to share it with someone,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1

The gypsy man plays on warm summer days And on nights neath a lonesome bright star He plucks a soft tune as he howls at the moon With the song of his Spanish Guitar There’s a bump on a part of this gypsy man’s cart And it thumps with each turn of the wheel It keeps him in time with his plucking and rhyme As he rides it from Rome to Castile The people all flock as the gypsy cart rocks And approaches the town from afar And they dance to his song as he rolls right along To the beat of his Spanish Guitar The rich folks will waltz to cheap German schmaltz And operas are all of the rage But the song from the cart has ten times more heart Than the music of balls or the stage So I rosin my bow and I join in the show And I sing to the moon and the stars But no fiddle can play in the rapturous way Of that gypsy’s sweet Spanish Guitar,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0

The first month I visited Larry every Friday We spent those cool fall nights with the heat on in his daughter’s living room watching jeopardy His shrunken body sunk into an oversized recliner I sat next to him on the couch I remember the wisp of white hair on his head That first month he didn’t say much Larry didn’t really care for jeopardy or television or anything really he said Except for Jesus So one Friday night I turned off the TV and we listened to Hallelujah Buckley’s voice belting from an electronic speaker about broken love and holy doves and Larry nodded his head Then he looked over at me with pale blue eyes and told me secrets Don’t be one thing one time and something else the next be steadfast in your walk and in your life Even though the world may reject you and you may be mocked and scorned yet it will be worth it all Larry told me that his daughter’s husband turned the TV up too loud Larry told me he never once had taken a vitamin Larry told me he loved the Lord Larry told me he felt alone Larry told me Sometimes we get so busy with the little cares of our lives that we don’t really know people the way we should especially family It’s up to us to cultivate relationships but we’re often too busy with our own little cares Larry usually finished his thoughts with but I don’t know I don’t know I went to see Larry the day before he died I held a straw to his lips as he swallowed a few final drips of ice water His daughter told me that he was close He took my hand and looked into my eyes Something pulled me in to those pools of blue and I melted An invisible line held us as I saw him fade slowly into eternity Hallelujah And then he said One glimpse of his dear face and all sorrows erase He said something else but I didn’t write it down I wish I had written it down Im a hospice volunteer and this is based on one of my experiences with a patient The title contains a few pieces of information from the sheet we get Name has been changed for confidentiality as well as a couple of minor details Larry was my first homecare case meaning that I didn’t visit him in hospital I visited him at his daughter’s house and we would just hang out and eat ice cream listen to music or read the Bible together I spent most every Friday night last fall hanging out with him He was a cool guy RIP Larry,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1
