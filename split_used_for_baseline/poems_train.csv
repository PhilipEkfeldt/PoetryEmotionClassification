I killed a mouse I did not realize it was a mother A few minutes later I found four baby mice tucked away in an old rag I used to dry off my car last summer Dont worry they couldnt watch her die Mother never got to pry open their eyes so this bunch of baby mice with baby bliss never had to worry about eyes My mind has a black fog I dont know what its called but I pray that its not called me It has a death grip on my brain that needs pried loose I dont want to live in my congested brain I want to live but only in the hot lava on my chest from long ago many months ago when Id walk under loud maple trees feeling the orange and feeling the breeze just thinking of ways to be the best man I can be for her and perhaps even myself I want to live but only if I find a new nightmare that doesnt just zoom closer and closer into that impenetrable wall of soaking brunette hair that I playfully flipped grapevining her damn beautiful face that she hated If I had found these four hopeless mice last August Id have gently pressed a warm and wet Qtip against their bloated bits to mimic the tongue of their mother Baby mice need to shit and piss thats how mother mouse gets her babies to shit and piss and live But its not August theres no lava on my chest Its time to ditch eraser sized rodents in the woods but Im too busy My lava left me and let me down but so did the rope It did the ropedydope and broke branding a brushburn into my neck that spoke to me like Anne Sullivan but in the language of burning skin instead of water and vibrations The muscles in my neck turned acoustic and my burning skin told me that if I try to kill myself again to just forget about it I dont deserve to live Not for myself not even for her damn beautiful face that she wasted The black fog had a death grip I pried it loose put it in a balloon with baby mice filled the balloon with helium then let go,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0
A maid from the Island of Wight Renowned as incredibly tight Had lovers whod wail When their exits would fail Theyre stuck with her all through the night A serial killer called Skinner Saw victims become somewhat thinner With great expectations He sent invitations To guests he was having for dinner There once was a beautiful lass Possessed of an oversize ass There was no surprise When it doubled in size When fed a rich diet of grass Lorena wished Bobbit was dead She sliced through his member in bed Then Dahmer found out So he gave her a shout Are you gonna eat that he said A curious princess named Alice Tried dynamite sticks for a phallus Repetitive thrusts And the dildo combusts Theres bits of her all through the palace,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0

I keep finding myself in this predicament Where I’m continuously typing and deleting Until the thing which I really meant Has been lost in hapless bleating Even now as I write you a new poem I can’t help… Oops No that’s not quite right… Let me try again To express myself correctly It can sometimes be a pain No I’ve said that incorrectly Rather an issue unsolved by time or reason Like writers block for chat My mind’s committing treason And here we are again all meaning fallen flat So I ask you please excuse my backtracking I’m sorry for my rambling and bumbling I swear to you I’m not just slacking And I’m sorry for always mumbling I promise I’m getting to my subject It’s just I still need to process what I want to say But every time I look back and reflect I have to ask What was I trying to convey It’s like an addiction I keep on writing without any real end Until suddenly it’s become some fiction That I must go back and mend Wait… Where am I now What was the point of all that Let me try again Just once more I swear You see I’ve never had this much trouble It’s like you genuinely make me speechless I’ll get an idea and it pops like a bubble And then I’m left there blank and breathless But it’s actually a kind of wonderful feeling It’s like composing a piece for a beautiful princess While I think of how I’ll deliver it perhaps kneeling No not that that would be weird But something like that Because romance isn’t dead It’s beautiful and vibrant and all that Its a cause for which some bleed red So Im back at it with pen held aloft Drenched in earnest glee And if my thoughts grow weak or soft I’ll think about you and me Well you and I is proper grammar However this is a poem And rules must be bent to aid in its glamour Did you know that hardly anything rhymes with poem Im at an odd point in the writing of this Where I dont really remember what I wanted to say in the first place And I cant make heads or tales of where to end So I should probably find an end or at least say something that holds some meaning I guess what I want to tell you… Is that I think youre amazing Youre beautiful smart and wonderfully kind You always put a little pep in my step And though you may not be ready I will sit patiently until eternity ends Believe me I’m stubborn enough So that’s what I wanted Rather needed To tell you Sorry it took so long Wrapping up this travesty of a poem Im glad Ive said my piece Again nothing rhymes with poem And with that this poem can finally cease,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1

Do you ever Wake up and its bright outside Picturesque spring late morning and You think good for some but not for me I think Ill just stay in today Do you ever Think that when its hot outside its too hot to go outside and When its cold its too cold to go outside And when its somewhere in the middle its just insipid and you need something to inspire some thing inside you Do you ever Feel like the wind lashes your skin and The light burns your eyes Did she used to call you a vampire for blacking out your bedroom windows But she didnt know the half of it Are your Best friends cats but you even get annoyed at them sometimes Do you ever Get a message from a real human a former lover former friend And you read it as soon as it arrives Because your phone is always in your hand And you come up with the perfect reply But you dont send it straight away because that would be weird It would be really obvious that youre dead So you decide to reply tomorrow but the longer you dont reply for the more anxious you get about replying Or more like Theres a sudden increase in anxiety after you dont reply for a day and then it stays along a long plateau of intensity Until you realise it doesnt matter Some months later Do you ever wish youd just shut up Do you ever Have this internal struggle over Whether to trust what people say about you or not Like it feels great to be respected But you know theyre just lying And you have to balance how you see it Do you ever Think about all of the things youll never amount to But entertaining the idea of them is alluring enough to Make sure your prophecies come true Do you ever think About just getting up Walking straight out of the house And not stopping walking and Just seeing what happens Do you ever think There are things which bring you joy but Theyre not the kind of things you can hold on to Theyre totally ephemeral And tuning yourself in to those stations is labour enough to dissuade you from trying And when did you realise That when they drag you off to hospital They dont actually cure you they just stop you from dying And it gets to the point where The doctor is asking you what you want and its like YOURE THE FUCKING DOCTOR Do you ever Think its a modern disease Its not your fault Not your mums failing Top 100 depression memes 2018 Stop staring at your screens Says the man Staring at us through our screens Whose entire business is built around digital platforms Do you ever hear People say my family come from Gaza but everyone here is much more miserable Like you need something to die for to have something to live for You need something to suffer for to have something to get pleasure from You need something to struggle for to have something to grease your wheels but that struggle cant be struggle itself How many of your friends and acquaintances Have half a million clauses to their professed identities And their epistemology does include the word community But only in the sense of short messages exchanged between people who have never met each other Have you ever thought Something needs to be done about this But Im too hungry right now And bought a kebab off Deliveroo And when the delivery man knocks on your door With your food in one hand and his phone pressed to his ear in the other And hes arguing with his girlfriend And youre wearing pyjamas at 6 oclock in the evening And you realise Hes not actually a delivery man at all Hes just a man Like an actual real human Just like you,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1
Late into the night When moonlight filters through my curtains and my eyes are at halfmast and my body is limp with approaching sleep I still feel her hand caressing my hair And her breath a soft whisper on my cheek And I almost forget that she’s an illusion I almost forget the phone call That shoved a fist in my throat And made me feel like I was attempting to swallow oceans The voice that felt like medicinal syrup in my ears She’s gone As my body becomes cymbals crashing to the floor Waves crashing into rocks Action disintegrating into reaction She’s gone And I wake With my hair in disarray Not from hands but from tossing and turning Goosebumps encapsulating my flesh Not from her touch but cool air coming through my open window And I remember The only constant in life is change,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0
How much can you extract Of the salt among the beads Of dead lovers white in sand There are many playing tag They chase flapping in the skies Spar and glide above my hair Theres a silent tango of wings That wakes the melancholic romance Of the waves and the breeze Invitation to the unfortunate lovers game ¤¤¤¤¤¤¤¤¤¤¤¤ And Im burnt of the sea That throws me along the bed Upon which it breaks Yet tries again to stand And like the sea I take My first steps Impressions adorning its coasts And it thrusts itself upon them A cruelty as it lunges As if history shall remember us both Head first in the sand Dragged across shore If I could swim I would walk up to the sea And hold her up But like a shy girl Shell hold her ruffles and recoil Far from me And if I dare venture close To her buzz and roars Shell dare upon me her weight And like all meek and unmighty men Shall I too succumb Under her massive thunder And go along till she beats me Back to the dust Im from,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0
Theres a melancholy your memory left behind Like one sole violin damned to play the same song till its strings snap Like drowning in desperation as I watched it all fall apart and leave only coffee grinds Theres a part of me that cannot forget it keeps reminding me like a knock on the door with a rhythmic tap God Im trying I am Is it cliche if I say my heart is lonely Like its surrounded by millions of others beating in time but I can only ever hear my own Like Im deaf to everyone but the sound of your voice if not yours then my heart only Thats the catch you and my heart are strung together sewn God Im trying I am I didnt know I knew not until the salty taste of my tears reached my lips Like hoping a rose will survive as you watch its last petal fall Like being 20 feet below water and being okay with drowning at your fingertips I keep silently repeating the words in the note you wrote me when you finally left I can hear it in my head like your voice in our last call God Im trying I am,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0
The purest and most tender love I have ever felt was for you Your power over me was so strangely foreign yet oh so welcomed You young one took priority Online articles told me what to eat what to wear what to expect Changes to my body were quick and fierce Swollen Tender Tired You a constant in my mind Like the ebb and flow of life and death But unfortunately you shared this space with another constant A constant that sprung his head upon your arrival Intense Fragile Angry Voices told me you werent good for me and like a puppet on a tight thread I obeyed I became too sick too frightened too alone The Puppet Master pulled on the string and like a bullseye arrow despair struck me A life permanently snuffed out Panic Lonely Weak It is only in the aftermath that I realized I will never hear your voice your laugh your cries Since you were apart of me I can only hope that you knew I never meant for this to happen The lakes would be jealous of the oceans my heart has wept for you and where you once were only a giant hole remains Guilt Guilt Guilt,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0

When I was 11 I made love in your classroom It was the first time for me and not the first for you I was a boy you see I was willing to give What you took from me I was scared and so were you but the sound of sirens didnt make me jump I was a boy who didn’t know yet you came to me and made a man of me When I was 11 You took my virginity The sound of bells on the hour were the background to skin on skin They were the clock to our sins I am grown now and the sounds of bells bring me back to your classroom There I am a boy becoming a man There you became a part of me Now I am 30 I make love in my own bedroom and the sounds of bells still get to me it was the squeaking of chairs and scratches on chalkboards that are the sounds of my PTSD When it got awkward I felt trapped by you The thumbs ups and congratulatories by my classmates couldnt hide the wrong I felt teachers pet couldn’t properly describe my cage I was lucky to get it so young The wise sex guru to all who asked a master among my class… but that didnt last when I was 11 I was raped in your classroom You took advantage of my naivety I was the victim of your depravity I can still hear the bells the clock to our sins skin on skin and the sirens as they took you in,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

She told me that all bad people are just good people on a strange path and all the saints are just secret keeping sinners or mediocre folks who never woke up on the odd side of the road Exceptional Evil is only the bedfellow of Ghandian Greatness I told her the saints had been such selfish lovers lately She said you’ve got two hands do it yourself He told me that travel is stupid because the only thing it can ever teach you is that everyone is exactly the same in different headwraps and ways of weaving floormats and bathroom habits but at the end of every day All everyone wants is a hot meal a good fuck a stiff drink and a cuddle to love their spouses and mothers and children to feed their pets and eat the rest and get on with it They all want to tell me about their Stuff how they used to have so much but now they just want to go fishing and drink topshelf liquor at thirdworld prices They all just want to wear harem pants and fill their pockets with the little white seashells that wash up on the beach in clusters We all want to tell about our bad habits how we tore them off like bandages and new skin bloomed underneath them Scars are just new masks I say but that is a very unpopular opinion When we sneak away into our seashell stashes we rattle them in our hands like underwater windchimes and imagine how they sounded clattering up and away from the ocean Some days when I look at the ocean she is a quilt of belonging ivory infinity folding over and over itself Other days she is the silver specter of regret and a thousand seashells thrown into her mirror face get gobbled up with only gagging bubbles for protests,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0
I did our laundry yesterday My face was just as wet as all the Clothes hung up to dry I saw the sweater that I bought you For Last Christmas that I gave you early to see you smile I did our laundry yesterday I saw the shirt that you wore on the Second day we met I smelled your perfume on your favorite shirt The one that calms me down Better than the meds I used to take I saw my shirt that you had ripped When we were just two kids Brand new lovers killing time I saw the dress shirt I had worn When you told me we’d bring a little Baby in this world I saw the jacket I was wearing When we smiled at each other When she said that it’s a girl I saw the clothes we used to buy at the thrift store by your work I couldn’t tell which sweater’s mine I did our laundry yesterday I did it all real slowly cause It might be the last time I cannot bear to see you go We’re all I’ve ever known And all I’ve wanted in this life I do my best to give you space To take it easy on all of these long texts I send at night But it’s hard for me to face I cannot put to words How I’ve been feeling in this way I guess I’ll just say please don’t go I’d give it all I could give just to hear That you would stay But I did our laundry yesterday I couldn’t bear the thought of dividing Yours with what is mine I’ll do our laundry again today Not because it’s dirty I just want to One last time,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1

So this is the first poem Ive ever written and I decided I might as well post it for some feedback on a brand new account and improve my admittedly questionable poetry skills Dear Friend Its been a while A break From the obsidian streaks Of all but life The smears and the stains of Irremovable darkness which Festers with every ounce of Pain and suffering Building like Lego bricks Up Up Up Into the sky The height is breathtaking Balance precarious The fall fatal The thin air circled our heads with Neon signs and warnings strung As fairy lights across our throne Yet we still managed to fall Down Down Down Dear Friend It just goes On And On To the next page The next chapter Right until the goddamn epilogue Where ink is splattered on Shattered shards Their blunt edges grazing Slicing Contaminating No regret Right until Im left for dea Dear Friend You once engulfed me Your hand wrapping mine A never ending hold Twisting into a choke As cracks widened Claws ripping straight Down through us Like brittle tissue Tearing into nothingness Leaving me gnarled and burnt Bloody and bruised as you Floated far far away Dear Friend Is it nice up there Watching Sniggering As I buckle beneath The noir falls to Pull tug scratch Kick and scream against the sheaths Leaving nothing But whispers across the dirty pale Resorting to tearing With stained teeth The persistent muffled scream Screeches for help Echoing in an empty chamber As I melt Sinking into the rushing stream A dull tarnished statue Dont worry dear friend Ill soon be joining you,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0

When a star collapses within itself the destruction is undeniable and cruel The planetencrusted shrapnel slams in between the lungs of the bystanders with their emerald breastplates and the ashes of their parents tucked in between their toes so that if they perish they won’t die alone As the universe let out a heaving sigh of surrender I looked at you up on your Jupiter throne and wondered if you helped create this universe for the sake of destroying it Your crown was made of a rosegold only obtained down in marthart It was studded with diamonds that looked like daisies that you plucked from the bushes outside your castle I presented you a sword and as i tore it from its sheath I nicked an artery just below your hip and I didn’t notice as the blood flooded the kitchen like you were Noah and the world was your arc I could see the dominoeffect of explosions encircling your pupils the yellow sundresses were replaced with black trench coats you didn’t want anyone to see the red I traveled in my orange space ship to retrieve what ever I had decided would fulfill you that day losing sleep to a harsh reality of 6 am wake ups and 2 am studying sessions I approached the throne when it became clear the apocalypse had a strong chance of obliterating the universe we so carefully crafted while we chipped our nails and you scratched your neck I always thought we were satisfied with the end result but i’ve discovered humans aren’t simple I asked you with my voice like Neptune When you held him did you feel me In the royal bed lying on the pillow I cradled you on when your kingdom faced revolt did you love him like you loved me Did you explore him like how you explored me Did you know every mark on his body did you know him like you knew me Did he make you feel safe Did he make you feel fulfilled Your tears slid down my wrist like morning dew and as I raised my voice I wondered where we’d gone As you shuddered behind your maroon gown I wondered where the hope had gone where the laughter had gone As the stars popped like balloons around us I wondered where I’d go next As our creation destroyed itself from the inside out I looked at you and I saw a stranger a parasite controlling the person I so desperately fought for and as I wielded my sword for one final fight I couldn’t help but wonder Was it worth it,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0

There is a pattern Ive noticed in boys who have never been kissed They cup each moment in their hand as if it were a precious crystal Their own personal flurry of melodrama and romance I contemplate the significance behind each of their individual robotic movements Their awkward twist of limbs choreographed together into a chaotic crescendo I allow myself to indulge and find myself lost in their unfounded passion It rests for a second sweet on my tongue but as always I find myself sinking into the black waters of an unending apathy For I myself have never known such boundless love I am not yet educated in the art of seeing the world through rose tinted lenses All and all is all I am And this is all that I have to give,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0

She lay folded inside my arms like a letter and like an angel she carried a divine message So I pushed the envelope and climbed inside her language On that day I parted the clouds and erased their white masses with the edges of my thumbs careful not to nudge her from the grasps of sleep I wanted to share her beauty with the Universe to take her by the hand and up into infinity to refuge on the outskirts of Pluto and swing on the rings of Saturn So I lifted the glasses pulling on her ears and folded them in my shirt I picked the litany of freckles sprinkled under her eyes and across the bridge of her nose one by one with delicate fingertips and one by one I drew them back into the sky as stars for all the world to see She did not wake but only shifted her head to fit more comfortably inside the pocket of my celestial shoulder stirring off further down the rabbit hole of another dream Now wherever Im without Her whenever I look up into the night I see Her beautiful face strewn across a bottomless canvas and I pray beyond a reasonable faith She will one day deliver upon me this same courtesy reach down inside my weary bones pluck the birthmarks off my arms and legs and torso one by one like wilting flowers bend down and kiss away the constellation of tears welling up inside the corners of my tiny smile kidnap me from my tiny corner of the world and drop me onto the arms of spirals into the far corners of the galaxy so I can join Her forever in the heavens,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1

If March brings life then November is the dying time Bare skeletons masquerade as trees and birds sit silent As grief flaps widewinged to perch across your back We share glances like children trading secrets Gathered like pagans around a standing stone One for sorrow and us in black a single shadow A raised hand against the weak sun your veil a shadow As dirt falls onto polished wood and keeps time Words come from you slower than blood from a stone My only consolation is this your arm against mine isnt silent Holding hands hidden by your coat sleeves your worst kept secrets Rest on my tongue like wafer like ash like things I cant give back Home is a place you left behind afraid to look back In case you saw someone at the window a shadow Heres a list of things you cant keep wishes secrets People wild birds They all escape you in time The wooden floors went petrified and groaning pipes went silent The rooms we walked were cold our pale bare feet on stone Im looking at window panes with hands empty for a stone But you turn away and I come to lay my head on your back Arms across your stomach and your heartbeat isnt silent But the early setting sun makes your face a shadow And you leave me in the garden to be alone for a time Keeping your own council keeping your own secrets Waiting I count blackbirds on the powerline seven for secrets That we cant even tell ourselves or Medusa with a mirror we turn to stone Someone told me once well meaning These things take time I had two choices I dropped my fist and turned my back A bird wings across the sky like a silky shadow I make a wish but keep it on my tongue sweet and silent The man they laid in the ground today had sat statuesilent When you first grabbed my hand fierce like you were screaming secrets Anger clawed across his face like a shadow And when he shook his head he turned your beating heart to stone But when we went out the garden gate like Lots wife I looked back With salt across my face and he had watched us walk away for the longest time Dont let us wait drawn silent as we run out of time Each of us refusing to give our secrets back Everything we love becomes a shadow when they put us under stone,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0

It’s 300am and I should have gone to sleep 3 and a half hours ago but instead I’m talking to this guy This guy with dead green eyes and slicked back hair with straight teeth and long legs He gets it At least I think he does maybe I just want him to He’s a sweet kisser when he’s sober and leaves bruises on my thighs after a couple beers I don’t mind he’s good company and doesn’t care that I’m hurting because he doesn’t care about much and I don’t want to care about anything at all But when we’re in his bed and he turns away from me instead of sleeping I connect the freckles on his back creating constellations out of tiny brown birthmarks He is beautiful and as I trace his skin with my fingers I feel a little more at home more than I have in a long time But then he sits up and reminds me that he doesn’t care and I remember that I don’t care either I walk home fighting the crisp autumn air and make myself toast in an empty kitchen and hit my head on an open cupboard and all I can see are stars,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1

oh hello don’t mind me i’m just here going through some good old fashioned teenage heartache not heartbreak no i haven’t the confidence to do anything about it it’s just an ache an ache for her and for all she is and was and will be she smiles and butterflies dance with fireflies in my heart each word she says is etched upon my skin for me to examine later in my dreams she is the woman that makes cheesy top 100 love songs feel like shakespeare because i finally understand the feelings everyone talks about that electric moment your heart beats faster you feel alive and i never understood because it was never the right person until her oh hello don’t mind me i just hope that one day one of us will work up the courage to say something to the other i long for the night that one special night not sex or kisses or anything so physical but words the real raw shit i mean the night that always happens at least once in a teenage relationship where the lateness of the clock falls on deaf ears where secrets and promises and tears fall on keyboards and bedsheets and on souls who know too little but feel too much who need sleep but dont care who always want more at the end of the day i’m just a boy who knows only what his heart says and not why or what to do about it and all i can do is hope she sees me as i see her at the end of the day im just a boy looking at the sky and finding deep truths in the clouds and rain with sad piano music drifting into my brain and hoping that maybe just maybe i have a chance at love,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1

Magic is not real And dragons do not fly Giants do not roam the earth I say it with a sigh Our heroes don’t have powers And rarely save the day But our villains don’t take over The world anyway Our carpets cannot levitate Nor can our broomsticks zoom Which causes me to cogitate What can we really do If aliens won’t talk to us And genies don’t abound Is there really anything More crazy than it sounds Where went the preposterous That wild unchecked wonder The stories that would foster us Have they been torn asunder Where went our world’s spark And why is there no flame And why upon inspection Does it all look the same Why is there no magic Why dont dragons fly Why cant giants roam the earth I just wish I knew why So if there are no sea monsters What’s left for me to draw In empty spaces on the map Of lands I never saw And how can I ever look up And see the twinkling stars And not feel so wistful for Something that was once ours And how can I not strive To bring back what was lost Restore the wonder once again Whatever the cost I wish there was magic I wish dragons flew I wish giants roamed the earth And made my wonder true,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0

Three years before you died your school threw a Christmas party The other mothers chattered by the drinks table timid children wheeled out stylishly accessorized with carefully rehearsed handshakes But we sat in the corner you and I and you read me a softcover book about a boy who went to the moon Nine days after you died the neighbours girl found their cat Mister Marley twentytwo dead in their front garden I came outside when I heard her crying but her mother ashen faced pulled her inside with stuttered apologies Leaving me alone with awkward echoes and an old dead cat Four weeks before you died you spent the day with me at work I packed your toys your books but you just sat by Suzies desk and watched her make calls When I asked why you said she talked like me The month after you died the counsellor Annie she insisted never Doctor Liu gave me a pamphlet Parents circle it read For those whove had a loss Three weeks it hung on the fridge until I caved and went but despite the hour drive I left five minutes in An empty room with nine adults each treading water in a private ocean of incalculable grief The day before you died we sat by the river and I sang to you an advertising song from television while you threw stale bread to the ducks Four years after you died Helen an intern in accounting told us her sister just had a boy Harry she said and hes the cutest thing youve ever seen My assistant who you watched that summer day remembered that was your name and she apologised in the elevator afterward as if you are ever far from my mind The day you died I chipped a nail I was late to move my car at lunch and an inspector wrote me a ticket I stood on the curb trucks rumbling past as in my pocket my phone began to ring,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1

I am peace I am the thunderous voices within that scream to you Cry out to you and tell you not to harm another soul They stem from the infinite connections we share The love that bonds every human being and every living creature together As our love grows so should these voices from quiet whispers To roars in a soundless night I am peace no longer do the wars rage inside my head No longer am I limited by all my faults mistakes and ignorance Now my smile hides no weary frightened little boy I am a man A man who looks at his world not as something to conquer and possess But as something to defend and make beautiful for all my loved ones So now I look to you little one don’t conquer but defend Don’t just remove the burdens from your shoulders and the chains from your feet Untangle those chains and lay them straight so that they may not entangle the next man Don’t create chaos where you go leave a paved road for your sons to follow This world should not be left as you found it make it better Leave a legacy of greatness not one of ill will and destruction Our bodies fade our memories fade but the changes we make to this world are permanent Don’t let a line of broken relationships or a list of petty deeds be the last memories of you Go out an even greater person than you came in with an even brighter spirit When you leave this world go to your resting place with a smile A smile so deep that no amount of decay can remove it from your face Don’t just be what they expect you to be be what you know you should Go out not as just a boy but as a man I am peace therefore I am at peace… be at peace,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0
An Open Letter to the Girl in My Bed Remember when you asked if you could kiss me The light in my head went off We broke the barrier of friendship and for the first time in a long time I felt hope I guess my hopes were too high When I realized You were still hers Remember when you threw yourself at me The animal in my guts roared We broke through the door to my bedroom and for the first time in a long time I felt passion I guess there was too much passion Because I forgot to ask if You were still hers Remember when I put a stop to this My conscience betrayed my needs I broke off whatever you want to call this and for the first time in a long time I felt guilt I guess there was too much guilt Because I hated that You were still hers Remember when we pretended we never had that conversation My body overtook my mind We broke the promise to stay just friends and for the first time in a long time I didnt care I guess I didnt care too much Because I didnt bother asking if You were still hers I know it hasnt been long but Remember when you fell asleep in my bed Youre still sleeping there now I broke off alone to go and think and for the first time in a long time I feel content I guess I feel a little too content Because I finally know that You arent still hers But you arent mine either And maybe you never will be Maybe youre only using me but I need you to hear this I know Im nothing to you but You make me feel alive Even if its all a lie,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1

This house has held me eleven years now I know each step each creak Waking each morning to the music of prayers or the pressure cooker’s shriek This house has watched me grow Ten to twentyone Served as nest and chrysalis Still growing to be done The first place I lived without my parents Was mine and mine and real And I paid the bills And I fixed what broke This flat is where I healed Where happy crept in with the sun warming the floor under my feet With the sound of London living At night as I fell asleep Your arms feel a lot like lying on clean sheets after a long day I can sit in your comforting silence When I don’t have words to say Or I don’t know how to say them Just don’t want to feel alone But falling into you feels a lot like coming home,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0

A Portrait of the ManicDepressive as a Young Man This is the worst ginger ale Ive had in my life I said to the white walls and fluorescent lights A recordsetting breakdown achieving the impossible Shooting for the moon and landing in the hospital Picking at the bracelet that bore my name and 21M Waiting for a mediocre meal that never even came Noticing the dirt and grime covering the floors I suddenly felt an irreversible shame The shame of my roommate escorting me to the psych center Making sure I didnt walk into oncoming traffic The shame of having to explain to my parents that every girl I ever loved has turned out to be an addict The shame of wanting to fuck the therapist because sex is the only thing that makes me feel anymore The shame The shame the shame of it all tore me to bits and the next hours blurred Forms Urine samples Blood tests Questionnaires Diagnoses Discharge Words I remembered my fathers words as I put on my sweater He said Son sometimes life doesnt get any better Now its time once again to get it all back in order Even though heartbreak is waiting just around the corner The moment you confided in me my beautiful friend The truth broke me in half and now it has to end And as I sit in my room with the indigo walls The lights are off and this ginger ale tastes like nothing at all,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1
Have you ever tried to dig into your mind To sift and root through the clutter accrued To cut and burn all which you have derived To wade through the shit to save those precious jewels ‘Tis an arduous task not many can bear To look themselves deeper through their own eye To tread through the reflection one should beware For you are the doctor with the best tools to pry They say it changes one reforms them anew An archaic practice with a purpose most just To probe the minds eye and realign the sinew Until there’s nothing left but the reflection of a husk But was the atrocity worth it to quiet the demand A catharsis in killing but your soul be damned,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0
Loneliness hits in waves Crashing upon the heart like a bullet when you least expect it The impact soon spreads to the brain Riddled with selfdoubt you think if you are worth it What are you doing wrong You could be sitting alone at night You could be talking with a friend But the gun always seems to fire and the impact always seems to occur Everlasting hurt your soul is subject to bear Sometimes further isolation can happen And sometimes you can surround yourself with friends But regardless of the balm applied to this perpetual wound the pain can be felt Loneliness hits in waves,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1

I cant open the box In the box sits three months Three months of hope Three months of planning Three months of congratulations Three months of youre going to be great parents Three months of her And when I look At the bend of the bow The tie of the knot The crinkled colored wrapping I see the crumpled shape Of the woman I love Whose love is too great To bear I see the weak wavering smile Of the woman I love Who worries that I worry As she wastes away I see love Measured in pain Measured in agony Measured in weeks upon weeks Trying to keep her healthy As the woman I love Lives love breathes love Weaponizes love Fighting her body at every turn For her And Im afraid that my tears Will shatter the remnants Of our broken family So I pick up the pieces I snatch up the future And I pack carefully I tuck the corners around Fifty years of struggling Of cakes and arguments Of sense and nonsense Folding and creasing and smoothing Until from the outside It just looks like a box We dreamt of a lifetime And came home with a box Dedicated to Indigo the daughter we will never have,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1
Start with a feeling Its not so much a feeling that you have on your own Its a manufactured thing something you claw out of the earth With soft unfocused hands As if God will spit gold onto your fingers at random Call it finding inspiration when you bare your teeth at the sky And demand beauty from it Finally find it when the clouds cry on your window with their Pitterpatpat Tapping on the glass whimpering Is this what you wanted But its not not quite not exactly Not that imagined ecstasy in the mind Look at the rain shrug Itll do Now take words and lay them out on an operating table They are stripped and silent worthless Until you make something of them Pick the ones you like and toss the rest Tear them apart letter by letter By sound by the taste of them on your tongue This one too bitter that one too sweet And paste them down on posterboard Like a ransom note to the world Lay with them let their blood dry to a paste The copper of it starts to sting Rip it up Try again Now bring it outside This Frankensteins monster of beauty and torture Thrust it on stage and make it dance Watch its feet move in that strange ballet That isnt quite lovely but not quite bleak Make it sing and it comes out strangled And this thing that was beaten out of the world Out of your soul is just as sad and broken As you are And when you cast it out and beg to God Make it beautiful make me beautiful When you take that broken glass and turn it Not on the world but on yourself That is poetry Rip it up Try again,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0

The Perseids As I sit and watch the sky awaiting my night vision to fully adjust the lectures begin in my head There Single finger to the stars The Big Dipper Ursa Major the big bear the consummate constellation to wow any fresh stargazer yearning to chart the expanse for themselves and give some organization to their universe But Ive seen those falling stars before Years trailing back to the radiant my individual wonder for them has waned I hesitate to measure the angles Where shines curiosity when all distances lie marked and all directions catalogued A rock cascading through the atmosphere Is assaulted by air molecules to create the blazing cape it wears for a brief moment before casting off to the horizon and the show ends Im only out here in the mystical moist night air because your wonder is waxing and should be magnified drawn into focus In this passing of knowledge my negative capability can be renewed It can perch back along behind Perseus and avoid being hardened by the gorgons of the world at least for a little while Your face illuminated by the dim night blinds my thoughts like the life of those ancient stones dashing toward obliteration with no care for the sharp fade lingering on the eye,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0

Maricopa To live after a storm is to remember And in remembering the details They become more vivid Like the way your voice sounded as I complained About the obscene number of candles That stood in the cabinetry To survive a storm is to recall Always will you recall these things And always will these things you see be different Like the way I refuse to name this poem Something that makes sense thematically Like To Survive A Storm To survive a storm is to hear the rain Always a soft pitter patter Just beyond the horizon even in its absence Like the way I shoehorn this stanza in To fit with the format I’ve set up Even when the words I’ve laid forth don’t make any sense within the confines of the narrative structure To survive a storm is to constantly reimagine The events as if they were yesterday And never tell the audience the struggle in any vivid detail Like the way I’m not saying the storm is specifically one thing Because to do so would be to detract from the value That a nonpersonal fluid narrative can bring To those facing their own storms My storm has long past And now I sit on a couch Unmoving in Maricopa,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0

I was born with flower buds sprouting from my skull Such silly pink things They were almost mistaken for little tufts of newborn hair I was a giggling mess My flowers running wild What lovely flamingoes my darling has Is what my mother told people at least They would smile through glazed eyes But even my tiny mind could see glaciers behind pupils Grossly black voids drilled into their own heads As I aged I tended to a garden Doves’ nests resting quietly in the blooming bushes But people had come to smile less Their eyes leaking shadows I didn’t know that glares could kill a forest One day a boy spewed nothings into my face But Nothing is a disturbing creature And it was verbicide mutated into herbicide I thought my flowers were beautiful though I drove violently down the road Watching as petals littered my dashboard I tried saving what I could But my head might as well have been burned to ash The only survivor of my garden’s apocalypse was a measly peony Barely breathing with a smoker’s lung I ripped her from my skull And I have never felt such pain I locked her into a cage Because she wasn’t even pretty enough to press into a book And now I was a member of the hallowed ones My onceearthy eyes were desolate Dying Probably dead I was finally cast into a deserving winter But even roses grow back after a sadlysung tragedy For it is the nature of nature itself Yet I was naive enough to deny myself of light It takes time I whispered to myself As I hesitantly unlocked my old friend’s cage She didn’t deserve such a punishment Seated atop my head again She smiled in the sun And I followed like a glowing mother But we are both still children Spring is just beginning my dear,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1

the first thing you will think of will be her shoulder blades and how they responded in unison to each meticulous heave and sigh that left her lips you will stare at the ceiling and think about how too many times you let yourself win in an argument how even after your business trips you were too tired to brush a strand of her hair back or at least pretend to care now you must practice the art of dismembering pieces of her in the tiny nook set out for reading and in the colors of your shower curtains like repeatedly ripping velcro off of the heart you thought she would spend an eternity in,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1

‘Twas the night before Christmas And all through the halls The guards dragged their sticks Across the doors and the walls Then an hour before Christmas Eleven to be exact The Count was in progress There was a flashlight attack They bang our beds to startle us awake Telling us to uncover it’s important to make The guards be aware you are breathing still His only invasion is to know if you are well Their footfalls are noisy with their keys aclang Their voices are loud like bells with a bang The department keeps us awake with fluorescent lights Something old St Nick would be startled with fright And then there are the searches throughout the day It’s Christmas again the guards get to play They toss all our presents our lives completely undone So they can get double time and have some fun Christmas isn’t Christmas here it’s just another day No lights no trees no holiday cheer no children at play Men just wake up to another day lost Surrounded by jailers and guards that think they’re the boss Then there are the phone calls From kids in ecstasy When are you coming home daddy To celebrate and be with me I just sit here tears rolling down my face Saying soon soon remember to set me a place Although in the back of my mind I have many years to fill To give to the state to repay the till Don’t get me wrong we all make mistakes We run through stop signs we forget to brake And then there are many here that have done much worse They have hijacked our lives and killed our thirst There are millions of men and women that upon this Christmas day They languish in the prisons sleeping their lives away We should all remember that we could be there too One wrong decision we make the action we take our freedom could be through I am one among you this lesson still rings true With all the pain suffering and time I still have to do But I believe in Christmas its forgiving qualities That gives a man a second chance to live with family All I can say is keep your life mistake free You don’t want to go to prison or to be a casualty This never was a good place for people to be At Christmas time or any time a place without a tree,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

A gentle kiss a playful tease Tearing clothes off with urgent ease I bite my lip fall to my knees Overcome with the urge to please Soft lips move south Hard dick warm mouth Small moan firm suck Hey babe lets fuck Our tangled bodies pussy wang Fit together like yin and yang Push it deeper I like it rough Theres no such thing as close enough You thrust I ride Up down side to side Eyes close hearts race Short breaths fast pace Pressure building my toes curling The thoughts in my head start whirling Your lips your dick its like a dream I cant help it if I start to scream Muscles tight ready to explode I cum so hard you blow your load The grand finale the feast of feasts We lay panting underneath the sheets How to describe perfect sublime How bout damn cant wait til next time,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0
Those who teach us such things do not like us brothers They brought us drugs and homosexual practices that even cows disapprove of – President JP Magufuli of Tanzania in a June 2017 speech Yes the cows disapprove of us my love They watch with narrowed bovine eyes as your fingers interlace with mine They look up haughtily from their cud mouths slack in good Christian horror at the brash way we speak in wordless glances Yes even cows would never dare to use their tongues to speak those saccharine words of devotion Or wrap their virtuous lips around the moistened paper of your cigarette after a long day of longing That guttural lowing could never harmonize with the deep richness of your voice And those churning chambered stomachs could never fill with the butterflies that flutter against the lumps in our throats Hold me woman Give me the deepest depths of your humanity Let me make a home in your intoxicating forever Until the cows come to tear it down,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0

You said that you liked peeling oranges Liberating the fragile life that’s been walled off I said that it seemed intrusive You said that it was satisfying That one day you just realize you are an adult And you go to work and you go to the store And you see all of these people despairingly disconnected Desolately walled off And you remember the warm embrace of your mother And the loving touch of her hands And you wonder why that went away And you want so badly to replace it To be acknowledged more deeply than a passing glance And you wonder if anyone else feels the same way Then you see a wall But it’s different than the others And you want to be on the other side So your nail scrapes the skin And there is an exhalation of vapor A burst of luminous droplets And it burn your eyes But through your tears You see the fragile life That’s been walled off,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1

The other day I texted my mom to ask about what I was like as a child She answered When you were a baby You were happy You always wanted to cuddle snuggle up You loved to wear dresses you loved the color yellow You’ve always been scared of storms She used to tell me the story of a thunderstorm that was extra greedy one night That it huffed and puffed hard enough to steal the roof from the hospital I called home it did When I was younger I was brave enough to fight the boys who made fun of me but not brave enough to fight the rain alone One night a thunderstorm shook the walls of my yellow room The sound of light breaking near my window took away all my bravery I took my pillow crawled underneath my covers cried cried until the weight of my comforter held me close to my mattress until I fell asleep A few weeks ago it rained for days The rain did not stop for me the rain never has the rain never will no matter how much I ask for it to stop at the foot of my bed The cacophony of water ticking on my window tree branches scraping the walls will continue to write an unwanted symphony to my ears Every time thunder roars lightning stretches down to touch the earth will be an ode to the kid that will always be here My favorite color was yellow it was the color of my room and my favorite sundress Now it’s some sort of purple I think,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0

She tread barefoot over cracked cobblestone and the snow crystals clung to her like prayers I asked why she bowed her head and she answered He will only recognize us for the backs of our necks But when I kissed her she tasted of salted earth and embers and when I bit her she did not bleed my father told me Watch your tongue so I learned to swallow bitterness and suck honeyflavored coughdrops with split lips A mother without a son is still a mother David you are onearmed hugs and alarm clocks needles smudged fingerprints long letters home Every love poem I have ever written is for missing you She tucks us in and sings the same songs that she made love to broke bread and cut hair to and I only learned how to kiss with a knife between my teeth Sometimes I wonder if she is sorry A sister without a brother is still a child She combed the leaves from her hair and took my hand and placed it on her breast Her heartbeat was a promise I wanted to believe but couldnt I asked what is brave about silence The sky leaned in to listen Her smile swallowed me whole The morning would whip the covers from our bodies like the sound of breaking glass and we were not dead yet fastening our hands to our wrists with red ribbons covered in the word Apology We learned to crawl on broken kneecaps to the arms holding the hammer and whole years would disappear into the cavernous expanse of a hungry mans throat How could we not crave loneliness when recognition was finding your own scars on the palms of another your own blood soaking stinking drenching the sand beneath a lovers feet She asks have you not learned to be humble Stones fall from the chimney and she shapes them into a throne I want to tell her that the secret to life is not dying Instead I cut my nipple and bleed forgiveness into her I hold her until she falls asleep on the first morning after my death I awoke colorless Every day since then I have eaten handfuls of apple seeds and scrubbed my face with pine needles bathed in dark wines and sipped gasoline All this to say I am not sorry for dancing at your funeral I must keep on with living until this heart can sleep,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1
