I always loved you best in the mornings hair down freckles askinder when your fingers curled over mine without trapping me there when you didnt ask me to stay but I wanted to Before the world demanded us to be who we were and we could be anything Before we opened our eyes and recognized our anxieties in each others faces In those moments with your breath promising nothing but another I think I must have told you I loved you with the backs of my feet on your thigh I think I must have told you how beautiful you were when you were sure no one was watching,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1
I am Icarus drowning in the sea In this sea of mediocrity On the wings of opportunity i flew But after a mistake i did not think through The jealous rays of the sun scornfull of my pride Melted my wings hoping i would fall to the ground Yet death’s restfull bliss Evaded me the Earth i missed Rather i’m now stuck like this As if my fame did never exist Suffocated by everyday life Yearning allways yearning for the sky,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0
Politics is a lot like sleep both begin with counting sheep The sheep are fine with this it seems We close our eyes and beg for dreams Legs twitch as a form of resistance As nightmares appear with more persistence Politics is a lot like sleep The price of dreams is rather steep We lay like stone unaware of the bliss Content with reveries oblivious to all amiss A dream is but a different reality Other than what we wake to see Politics is a lot like sleep From the abyss we reluctantly seep Time to rise but our eyes refuse For a time it’s time to choose Back to bed or call it a night We yearn for it but dread the light Politics is a lot like sleep Beware the monsters in the dark who creep,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1
it was not intended this dull ache in my chest reminiscent of broken yet mended hearts even though i never gave you the chance to break nor i given the chance to mend it was never intended for my voice to surface so meek so scared of impending refusal it was not my intent to fall in love with your fleeting words and faded smile not my intent to love not a choice but a chore to see you and feel the dull ache evolve into something so sharp hurtful and unneeded i never intended any of this and i’ll serve my apology on a silver platter and only hope you may accept,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0

When I was six I had this idea this image about holiness that holy was a chair It was Sunday School she was talking was scraping chalk and she said Gd Is In Everything and wrote it too mysterious middle dash in the looping cursive of a Grown Up which looped the way a whisper does when a Grown Up says something looping it must be true And she looped to us sitting in that semicircle Gd Is The Hills The Earth and her hands shook spun down like melty ice cream The Spirit Hears You and Knows You And He Is Here In The Beauty Of A Sunrise even in this room I raised my hand Even In That Chair she smiled Even In You My chair was orange plastic worn down in the center stray jean fibers from a different kid were wrapped around a loose seat screw it had three holes in the back pencil marked a doodle of a boxer with fists and I whispered Gee Dash Dee are you in there I’m sitting on you Gee did not reply I was in his mouth We went to Olive Garden that night the pasta looped like cursive and I thought I saw him in my spaghetti My toothbrush was probing for a holy thing between my teeth and I asked Can you walk backwards through years and undrop me from the sky Would it be that easy and I spit Gee out in the sink And I came back last year to that old dusted room they replaced the chalkboard with markers my teacher was gone but the chairs were the same and I thought about the chairs were they always this small,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0
There were two kids doing lines off the marble kitchen counter the fine powdered sugar leaving red pimples on their philtrums They wore identical red hoodies and they were both brunette with green eyes they had scars on their bottom left cheeks I heard them sobbing in the bathroom they were holding each other like how children hold puppies the joy was almost eerie in their cries for help Maybe it was the cocaine I was draped over some blonde girl whose name started with an A and who went to some school in the general vicinity and she told me right before i picked her up and wrapped her legs around me that she hadn’t seen the new Star Wars and it made her feel isolated You smoked weed with your boyfriend out by the pool and you felt so far away and even though your lips were an inch away from his your hand was on my face and the moon licked the darkness underneath your eyelids the music shook the house with each beat and vases filled with ashes of relatives long gone stumbled and shattered like they were made of styrofoam I sat alone in the master bedroom surrounded by everything I could possibly remember dating all the way back to skinning my knee back when I was four and the world crumbled before my eyes,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0

You stood there smoking your cigarette I watched it burn for you the way I do My mind stumbled over what to say next I never could get it right anyway But awkward silences didnt matter as long as I could be next to you Smoke billowed through all the empty spaces around us You looked at me and smirked as if you knew how weak you made me Your lips curved over that filter I found myself wishing youd want to curve those lips over me,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1
I watched a show where lovers kissed Pity I shall never do the same Girls will not listen to my lips Let alone meet them with theirs Okay Any more words like this And I’ll start sounding Like an incel I write these words on the notepad Of my phone It’s always there for me Where I can bury my sorrow In meaningless things Then catch sight of your face And feel sorry for myself Again And again And again How pathetic I have been Twice have I promised To never write about you again And twice now I have failed Taking to my poet’s honour With the sledgehammer The sledgehammer of worthless gnawing Contemptible love Did I honestly just say poets honour Honour What honour is there in this act of mental ecstasy Where is the honour in drooling over your mere memory Like a stray bitch over decaying flesh Where is the honour in not being able to move on like everyone else manages to do You my muse when did I last hear your word When you and I were but children Innocent And free And your voice has faded in my mind For even the broadest of deep dismal caverns Cannot draw out an echo Forever This poem is a mess The words are not beautiful For this love is twisted A canker taking root Where it cannot be drawn out How my heroes would sneer At this angsty regurgitation The verbal diarrhoea Of a worthless adolescent That doesn’t matter You won’t even read this thank Christ I write for strangers I can say no more Perhaps I can tell you about violent bloody cuts to the wrist But that would be a lie for I dare not Hell I’m even an outcast among my fellow depressives At least they can bear the sight of blood Goodbye cruel world No I can’t do that either What more can I say But goodnight To the crisp cold Airconditioned air,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0

Do you know the morning Do you know the day Do you know the night that lives to give the light away I knew you in the morning when you were just as green as the tree that never lost its leaves for fear that it’d be seen You loved to love and listened to the songs of all your friends before you knew them well enough to see that it would end I lost you in the bright sun when for so long you left everything you knew before and cursed life’s petty thefts But soon enough the still winds brought you back into the bay your patience like all bonds that fray as you settled into the days Look forward to the good night I won’t be there with you to see when every word has lost its weight and the tree has lost its leaves It’s then you’ll know the answers to your questions all depend Do you know about the dark and dreams that seem to never end,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0

You and I we have the same blood through our veins And the same veins through our foreheads Living there in the hollowedout spaces between your vein and mine I became versed in the art of becoming transparent Slipping through wooden doorways dented and splintered by fury Stepping delicately over minefields hidden under plush carpets of kindred smiles My silent rhythms were tuned to those syncopated beats that punctuated your tired tin can symphony of expectations In that place I carved my comforts from the gaps between our matching picketfenceteeth and enclosed myself behind thick sturdy walls built from borrowed bricks of wry laughter Now when my lover asks me why I love her so quietly I want to whisper to her When eggshells are your floorboards you learn to lighten your bones,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1

to all the boys that have I have loved 1 thank you 2 I am sorry 3 I won’t forget C when ‘private numbers’ brought us together I did not know that I would fall in love with the image of what we could have been but we were only thirteen we were not strong enough to carry an emotion much older than us It fucked us both up even now seeing you makes my knees week I’d do anything to go back to twenty twelve I think every once in awhile I still wonder when I stumbled upon you W everyone saw it coming except for you and I you knew the truth but loved me anyways I gave you all of my firsts and you tried to teach me about love but how can I love you when I didn’t love myself I was never content but it was not your fault you deserved much more than my half heart I’ll never stop being sorry I know from the start R we were just a pitstop along the way a shoulder to cry on and an ear to listen I’m not really sure if I loved you but I can still remember what hope and redemption tasted like but we never loved each other at the same time the push and pull became tiring and alcohol was easier to consume I do not know a goodbye more beautiful I dropped everything for us H because I believed we were soulmates and your mother started calling me ‘daughter’ so I finally let you in and you started breaking promises the resentment turned me numb but you were the happiest I’ve ever been our future together was just not worth the struggle of pretending that we could read each others minds but don’t worry we’ll reunite every moonlight at 1111pm F you picked me out of the best and took me home and I wanted to give you everything but you were trying to build a kingdom from ruins of course it was bound to collapse you made me feel so whole and I think happiness is a beautiful look on the both of us I’ve never let anyone in so easily but now I understand why I hadn’t and I really should have met you first because then maybe you can be the only man I’ve ever loved,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1
A poem about mismatched libido in a modern Christian marriage Because it happens and it’s really tough Narrator only wishes she hated sex Edits Capitalization formatting punctuation per commenter’s advice I Hate Sex a poem I no longer wish you would push me up against the wall and ravish me right after work Which is all well and good because you never wanted to anyway I no longer want to try new things in new places in the safety of your arms Which is fine because your hesitation brings me pain It used to sadden me not being enough to make you feel safe and secure enough to try But I’ve learned that we can’t be everything for each other I denied for a while that I would have to give up on becoming the sexual woman I’d hoped to The one finally free to explore herself within the holy bonds of marriage Finally safe Finally clean It hurt so badly to think I had set her loose only to watch her beat her wings against the bars of larger cage Over and over I nursed her wounds and she would try to fly again Over and over she fell Until finally I asked her Please stop trying I’m embarrassed to admit I mourned her loss of flight Pridefully I discouraged her pathetic attempts to spread her wings Stop it I told her You will hurt him and he cares for us Watch how he tries It’s not his fault He does not deserve to share our pain We know how much it hurts to change Feebly I tried to protect him from her demands My only pride came from seeing those wings tucked neatly against her back I pinned them there myself with words so harsh and scathing eyes full of disdain When she reached upward arms and wings my heart sank fearful for her pain and our shared disappointment Why doesn’t he want me She would cry aloud whenever I shared his bed I tried to shut her up so I could sleep But she fluttered and fretted incessantly Until I was forced to shake him awake Why don’t you want me Her words tumbled out of My mouth IT ISN’T TRUE I tried to scream But I couldn’t She had stolen My breath and My voice His soothing words calmed her I felt life breathed back into to me My lungs filled themselves with air in greedy snatches I’m sorry I tell him myself when I am in control again I’m so sorry I woke you I know you need to sleep I don’t want to cause you sorrow His eyes are sad and his voice husky He thinks he’s let me down It makes me hate her even more I decide I need to kill her So that she can no longer Cause my loved one pain I watch disgusted I witness her gazing beyond her confines I am transfixed and horrified because she imagines soaring through other skies How dare you I think when she confides in me that she drifts to sleep at night imagining herself in the arms Of a hungry man It does not help or make it okay that he is no one in particular or that he doesn’t actually exist Nor does it help that he is never mine because fantasizing about him the one she truly loves stirs her awake too much inside It does not matter I tell her You are filthy You are greedy You are wrong She retreats sad knowing I am right But I do not end her dreams I let them happen because they keep her quiet Oh Lord is she quiet It is a shameful victory I isolate myself Close her away Pray to fill her void with children and noise and a busy home But when the quiet comes I live in fear of her,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0

in the summer we were ghosts lonely lovers who only existed sometime in the space between midnight and sunrise sitting crosslegged in tennis courts or holding hands on park swings drifting in and out of 24hour convenience stores sipping on slushies that made our kisses cold and blue in september we fell back into these earthly bodies felt the flesh of people deemed more real we stopped haunting an empty town and joined the crowd instead sometimes I wonder if we really happened at all,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1
I know a structure Built atop a round marble base Surrounded by columns That hold a dome against the sky It is a finite place Built on an endless plain And under its dome Is a timeless wishing well She’s there standing in front of the well And facing the horizon Her back is turned to me Familiar and unknowable Her Elysian figure is Draped in a thin teal dress And Her long golden hair Falls in delicate curls I step into the marble building And approach her As one always does I come just beyond arm’s reach And then she walks in an endless circle I follow her forever Our path bounded within the columns Around and around the wishing well With each lap under the dome The circle slowly closes Gravity draws us to the center And after forever we arrive at the well And then there is no she nor I There is only a wishing well Unfathomably deep Beneath Eternity’s dome,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0

you kept a dying houseplant in your room always that is to say you kept a houseplant that you so fervently wanted to breathe life into and the houseplant always had different ideas you tried orchids first blue and purple petals unsheathed like winter coats shriveled sprinkled around the base as they withered potted massacres You cried when the last leaped off the windowsill in a gust a desperate attempt at salvation perhaps Theyre finicky You would murmur hair spilling about your face as you cooed and begged and implored them to live You stopped naming them after the third so then you took up castirons sunk your fingers into their tangled roots stroking the dust from their fronds as you whispered please the cold took those too frost that struck them brittle and pale death creeping in slowly as you could only watch I found you one night on your knees and then finally inevitably succulents near indestructible hearty Requiring little to no care little to none of your excessant adoration And yet you sobbed into my shoulder and I wanted to shake you wanted to ask why the fuck you cried over these small brown carcasses when the world served you enough sadness to plant a garden of resentment an orchard of spite The day I met your mother I tripped over empty flowerpots littering the front steps and the air was stale and stunk of neglect and you squeezed my hand like it was the only tether you could recognize and you shut your eyes when she closed the door that night you mourned silently weeping over lost childhoods and dead houseplants,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0

This poem is nihilistic Unnecessarily conceited and artistic I’ll probably defeat and defile Any classic poetry style At least for a while Then I might drop the rhyme scheme altogether Time to get conversational Are my hamfisted attempts to be meta irritating Are hamfists too fleshy to break fourth walls Was that too transparent to be clever Does the fact I draw attention to my intention redeem its cleverness Is this even a poem anymore Will this get upvotes because its honest I don’t know and don’t care Because this poem is nihilistic But then why did I bother to write it Now that it has been about a day I can reveal the purpose of this poem A poem by uspitwitandwater inspired me to think about how poetry is received here I had a hypothesis that poems that are cliched or artistically but unjustifiably vague often do better than well crafted poetry I know in my experience that poems which I tried to be very honest or in ones that I spent longer amounts of time on were not received particularly well in terms of upvotes or volume of comments So to test this I wrote this poem in a couple of minutes and posted it The poem is not good It is inconsistent transparent and pointlessly abstract However it also got 26 upvotes in less than 24hrs and is by far my most successful poem on reddit I am not saying I am clever or that my other poems are masterpieces I simply wanted to point out that there is a trend here to praise certain kinds of poems that dont always deserve it while other absolute gems that I have read have been ignored Thankyou all for your replies and thanks uspitwitandwater for inspiring me to begin this little test,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1

Run she says and you do hand in shaking hand her laughter holding back the rain better than this your most handsome coat The fairground lights are roses whirling by and in the shelter of the ferris wheel a small boy holds a giant bear disbelieving overjoyed at what he has won A bus is pulling in just beyond the gate but instead of relief you taste despair You wished this night would never end At last You take your coat from the breakroom The winter months are here in earnest but the dark walk home reminds you of a carnival That fairground is long dismantled but together you have built your own two young lovers in a city flat You pass a restaurant its lonely owner hoping to entice a customer in from the cold The aroma brighter than the light spills into the street but reality cannot taste as sweet as the idea You head on for Home Nothing like the tiny flat all but forgotten in the busy lives of two important people Her smile is nervous her questions desperately casual Unseen on your shoulder are two long blonde hairs camouflaged against your most handsome coat You fidget with a sheet of bubble wrap discarded with the days mail Taking unconscious pleasure in each unthinking tiny act of Destruction An ornate mirror four thousand dollars a wedding present is shattered in the entry hall Over one bannister the tattered remains of a wardrobe started with scissors finished with tears She stands at the top of the stairs Jaw set firm but one hand still shaking and holding a phone on the screen a woman holds a smiling child Her mouth is closed her lips are tight but her eyes still speak Run she says and you do,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0
My ship will come Its been gone awhile That last time it sailed away I watched her up at the wheel All covered up in scars All emptied eyes and mascara running like razor cuts But she gripped the wheel tight I remember that much That little I suppose Her words were always a dizzy blur And we were firm believers in making up The ones we couldnt find But the made up words were gone Her lips tighter than her white knuckles on the helm Sunk shut because I opened mine At least if I did any one good thing it was send her away And I know when my ship sails back She wont be on it But maybe this time I can be on that wheel Not some damn Island we made All covered in scars tear running like mascara Ill grip that wheel tight,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0
the journey lasted 1 night born on one hemisphere now in another i was deprived of transition not allowed to savour no mans land i went from frontier to frontier from father to father there where i was hidden now i am stripped bare my motherlands converge in my navel bone and my spine aches from being held face down ass up by generations and generations of shame the shame of my grandfathers weights me down it swirls like a vortex at the base of my being forming a phantom limb the exact same one i made sure to sever off my body along the ties that bind me to my fatherland from sad and chaste to leaving no orifices unperforated to being uprooted,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0

I said Fine But not the regular kind of fine The kind of fine that feels like an overworn knitted sweater meeting a stubborn splintered desk corner unraveling wildly against the tug of not doing enough not saying enough not trying enough not listening enough not being enough or the kind of fine that feels like two searing knives dipped in poison playing tictactoe on your chest except no one ever wins or loses or cares or tries or listens and everything hurts and nothing hurts and its all finereally fine The kind of fine that wakes you up at 309AM smelling like thick smoke and burning wood as it billows underneath your bedroom door but youre on the second level of your stepdads house and youre too scared to jump so all theres left to do is panic or cry or suffocate or open the window and yell for help but no one is coming so you attempt to calm yourself by thinking of other things like if fine were a color it would look like an electric orange sunset you know the ones that distract fine drivers and send fine tenwheeled trucks off the sides of fine bridges I cant remember what she said after that or if I took my medication this morning,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1

You are my dirty laundry The shirt I wore over and over again always putting off washing for you were once my favorite shirt to wear But times change You are my dirty laundry I find myself tossing you into my washing pile Hiding you away deep down I cant bring myself to wash or wear you anymore There is more to my wardrobe You are my dirty laundry I’ve found other clothes that fit me That are new and clean That make me feel beautiful And it’s no longer you You are my dirty laundry It’s not until I finally do my laundry that I finally feel you are gone For once my clothes are clean Your scent that comes with so many memories goes away You are my dirty laundry Because even after being washed some stains and holes remain And looking past them is hard I still cant bring myself to wear you You are my dirty laundry But not for much longer hopefully You deserve to be worn by someone who looks past those tears and stains Who complements your colors and prints better than I can which is why Im giving you away You were my dirty laundry but I’m not ashamed I’ll always remember how good we used to look and I’ll cherish our times when you fit my body like a glove But sometimes clothes go out of season and bodies change And now I am drawn to a new statement piece,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
There are arrows in my quiver There are buttons on my coat There is fluid in my liver Theres a tickle in my throat There are mumbles in my pocket There are spiders in my head Theres a ball inside my socket There are raisins in my bread There are words upon this paper Theres a comet in the sky There is water in my vapor There is no excuse to cry Theres a mist for every morning Theres a storm on every sea There is truth to every warning There is something wrong with me There is no use in denying The apparent errant fact That Im selling what Im buying With extraordinary tact But if anyones displeasures Are the products of my word Id suggest that they take measures To discard what they have heard It is not my place to borrow From beyond the gilded gates Nor is it to dwell in sorrow On the shoulders of the greats There is nothing on the docket There is no one in my bed Theres a mumble in my pocket There is nothing to be said,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1
