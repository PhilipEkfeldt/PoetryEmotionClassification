# PoetryEmotionClassification

In this paper, we attempt to perform multi-label emotion classification on English poetry. This domain presents a number of challenges, chief among which are the apparent lack of annotated poetry data and the subjectivity involved in emotion annotation. In an attempt to determine the degree to which song lyrics are similar to poetry specific to the ways in which they express or evoke emotions, we employ a dual attention transfer mechanism and augment the learning of emotion from poetry using sentiment learned from song lyrics.
