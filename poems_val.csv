I am a vessel of blood bone and heart A body coated in sun soaked skin splattered with the freckles and spots of age yet to come How simple it is to be alive in theory but I am more than just a wilting flower These are strange and heavy moments of clarity in an otherwise fluid existence A hitch in the gut a flash forward to some sterile room with machines whirring and beeping and hands clutching hands in final moments How easy it is to lose track of our breaths How normal these mysteries have become How often I forget to revel in the beauty around me the mountains the oceans your eyes Feedback 1 Feedback ,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0
Brittle bones on sinew string Slice of beak and plume and wing Scraps of fur with ebon beads Twisted bark from septic seeds Crystal charms and stones that float Rest upon the Shamans throat A chilling hum which glows bright red Spells out letters never read And sings in voices seldom heard To speak in tongues without a word Ensnared or caught with all perceived The Shaman sits beneath the trees Which whisper loud with leaves that peel And splinter open to reveal A face that frowns with mirthless glee In asymmetric symmetry It screams to tear the jagged sky The Shaman never wonders why Visions swim across the ground Shouting bold in silent sounds Which echo through the empty space And standing still you start to chase Those calls which split this senseless scene The Shaman watches the unseen All at once you do regain Your thoughts Yourself as you restrain From thinking back on what just passed But still you turn to try and ask The Shaman who could make things clear Already He had Disappeare,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0

The days are mainly gray in May and those days I mainly feel this way As I ponder the rain and the plains of Spain to dull the pain of this mental plane No drive to work or urge to play until the dark clouds fade away And with them from my shoulders take the burdens that most heavily weigh Allowing the sun to shine it’s light and clear the fog behind my eyes Giving way to take safe flight down my foreseen path once it dries For now though I must sit and wait using this time as a needed break To take count of what is most at stake and which things of mine I must forsake Though doing so may cause some pain and my face to turn wet from facing the rain But it must be done and done this way All in the hopes that there will come a day where the sun is bright and there to stay And on that day I’ll give thanks to May for those days that were mainly gra,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0

We walked as one through antique land Down streets of cobblestone And felt whilst strolling hand in hand We’d never be alone But ambling there without a care My blood began to chill And rounding corners with despair I spoke at once all shrill Let’s leave my dear let’s turn away Cast off these troubled trails She’d seen I saw with full dismay A sign advising ‘Sales’ My love we simply MUST you see Your sleeves they’re all askew She carried on with naked glee And what about your shoes You’ve barely bought a stitch this year She lied behind her smile Let’s hurry now to the cashier She shoved me down the aisles But dear I spluttered full of dread We mustn’t pause our plans We’ve booked and paid and called ahead She grasped my clammy hands My love you really mustn’t fret It simply will not do She added with a touch of threat Let’s see about those shoes Those soulless soles will have to go The lace is one big knot The leathered holes reveal your toes The aglets agle not And whilst we’re there your fleece is floss Your jumpers seldom jump For when you dress it’s mainly dross The ties are one big lump Your slippers slip your zippers wilt Those briefs are now a thong I’d rather die than see your kilt Combined with that sarong Your scarf A laugh That vest A jest Overalls are over All in all we’ve just one quest To dress you like you’re sober And so I had to acquiesce To save me from her tears Depressed to dress and in distress We’ve been in here for year,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0

She tread barefoot over cracked cobblestone and the snow crystals clung to her like prayers I asked why she bowed her head and she answered He will only recognize us for the backs of our necks But when I kissed her she tasted of salted earth and embers and when I bit her she did not bleed my father told me Watch your tongue so I learned to swallow bitterness and suck honeyflavored coughdrops with split lips A mother without a son is still a mother David you are onearmed hugs and alarm clocks needles smudged fingerprints long letters home Every love poem I have ever written is for missing you She tucks us in and sings the same songs that she made love to broke bread and cut hair to and I only learned how to kiss with a knife between my teeth Sometimes I wonder if she is sorry A sister without a brother is still a child She combed the leaves from her hair and took my hand and placed it on her breast Her heartbeat was a promise I wanted to believe but couldnt I asked what is brave about silence The sky leaned in to listen Her smile swallowed me whole The morning would whip the covers from our bodies like the sound of breaking glass and we were not dead yet fastening our hands to our wrists with red ribbons covered in the word Apology We learned to crawl on broken kneecaps to the arms holding the hammer and whole years would disappear into the cavernous expanse of a hungry mans throat How could we not crave loneliness when recognition was finding your own scars on the palms of another your own blood soaking stinking drenching the sand beneath a lovers feet She asks have you not learned to be humble Stones fall from the chimney and she shapes them into a throne I want to tell her that the secret to life is not dying Instead I cut my nipple and bleed forgiveness into her I hold her until she falls asleep on the first morning after my death I awoke colorless Every day since then I have eaten handfuls of apple seeds and scrubbed my face with pine needles bathed in dark wines and sipped gasoline All this to say I am not sorry for dancing at your funeral I must keep on with living until this heart can sleep quick note i know this one is quite long but i appreciate any feedback you can provide definitely still workshopping it so would love some opinionssuggestions edit the second grouping of three lines stanzas is supposed to have the middle line of each stanza indented Couldnt figure out how to make it work when posting so for now will leave as i,1,0,0,1,1,0,1,1
On lucky nights sleep waits for me with a new lover Darlings I remember none of your names but sometimes a face One time you looked like Margot Robbie and saved me from a serial killer dressed as my grandmother Later you looked like the tech guy from that time I tried theater and we toppled a global poetry conspiracy Last night you looked like an old lover from my waking life Nothing happened and this one was my favorite It’s only ever me in disguise I know how to be grateful for fragments The tendrils that become an afterlife Still I’m sorry for the waking moment when I accept forgetting Sorry for the touches I have ceded – what lives I have made then unspoole,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1
you seem to drink alcohol a lot my therapist speaks with hooded eyes over a ratty notebook do you drink to forget him oh but i do a lot to forget him i kiss boys that i don’t know because they taste of cigarette like him i do a lot worse than kiss because i don’t want the last person to be in me to be him but he always is he’s always in me when i buy my groceries at 2pm when i gag over the toilet at 3am he’s all i know it’s ironic really i wish i drank to forget him but in incoherence it stands the same that all i can think about is him when the party draws in and my world is spinning his name flashes like a broadway show on the front page of my mind when it’s the middle of the night and i’m emptying the poisonous contents of my stomach i see our past in the remnants my pupils are dilated to hell and i can see his face in the black if i’m drinking to forget him it’s not working how do you forget someone who became a part of you someone who became the oxygen you breathe the liquid in your bloodstream feedbac,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,1
My ship will come Its been gone awhile That last time it sailed away I watched her up at the wheel All covered up in scars All emptied eyes and mascara running like razor cuts But she gripped the wheel tight I remember that much That little I suppose Her words were always a dizzy blur And we were firm believers in making up The ones we couldnt find But the made up words were gone Her lips tighter than her white knuckles on the helm Sunk shut because I opened mine At least if I did any one good thing it was send her away And I know when my ship sails back She wont be on it But maybe this time I can be on that wheel Not some damn Island we made All covered in scars tear running like mascara Ill grip that wheel tigh,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0
I try not to write poems about you To stop the cliché of heartbreak blood on page tearstreaked lines confusion nostalgia and loss But I wake with your eyes in my head I see the world as you had through haze with a chip on your shoulder as art as potential Then I walk the world with our pain in my bones Each step a million mile journey convincing my feet I know which direction to travel That loss is not being lost And I sleep with your memory Dreams swirling and mantras repeated reminders that I did not act alon,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1

A Mystery I see your face everywhere I look You took my world by storm a Blitzkrieg of my mind and like lightning you vanished all too fast Posthaste you became my centerpiece a day to day unachievable notion You taunt me with omnipresence yet at all times you are a million miles away You haunt my spirit with fascinating relevance a blistering persistent scar of the past yet your face is as new as each day is young Try as I may to push you away my being won’t allow you to leave me It’s as if our presences must always coexist yet a bonding is a promise of failure My heart demands my effort with logicfree argument I am the actor of its will and unwittingly obey my orders I mean no harm but am still far below your character To be good enough is to become a god or the manifestation of malevolence itself Who you are or truly aim to be will remain a mystery unto me it’s not to be said that you yourself yet kno,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0

Someday Ill tell you a funny story About how getting lost with you one afternoon made me feel like I was exactly where I needed to be That when you held me and eased my childish fears after a long night of drinking it felt like love And when I woke to find you asleep a full 12 inches away I wished it was a different kind of love Someday Ill talk in detail Of how for a while you were my home Ill let you in on how the thought of spending the rest of my life with you seemed for a moment blissful Ill make you understand that when you kissed me behind my ear and we said our goodbyes I felt a lump in my throat and the beginnings of a chronic homesickness Someday is not today tomorrow or the day after that Someday should it exist is when we have settled comfortably into our lives and our arms are home to different people When there are too many things standing in the way of us acting on our whims When declarations of former nonplatonic love can do no harm Someday we will sit intimately as old friends do Exchange pleasantries and engage in a little playful arguing as we have always done And when Im sure all other stories have been told I will ask you if you have time for one more Feedback give,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0
I wake up and taste poetry in my mouth and thats how I know I have been dreaming about you again There are a thousand planets living in between your eyelashes alone but I promise not to love you like you are my universe It would be dishonest and you probably deserve better than that My mother keeps asking me why Im peeling my lips away to get rid of a name Ive never kissed and I still dont have an answer for her yet I stopped playing piano in the seventh grade when my hands started shaking so badly I thought they were drunk I look for you in raining sunsets and flowers on other girls doorsteps I cant tell if you are there or not I have never asked anyone to stay before but that doesnt mean I dont cry when they leave I spend a lot of time writing about people who cant remember the color of my eyes and maybe I should keep things like that to myself We arent meant to be together in this lifetime so well have to try again in the next one You have to promise me youll be waiting because I dont think I can lose you like this again Theres only so much poetry I can write about your hands before I start to forget what your love line looks like and where it leads to Ive been telling myself this whole time that it was leading to me Maybe Ive been wrong Please tell me Im not wron,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

I killed a mouse I did not realize it was a mother A few minutes later I found four baby mice tucked away in an old rag I used to dry off my car last summer Dont worry they couldnt watch her die Mother never got to pry open their eyes so this bunch of baby mice with baby bliss never had to worry about eyes My mind has a black fog I dont know what its called but I pray that its not called me It has a death grip on my brain that needs pried loose I dont want to live in my congested brain I want to live but only in the hot lava on my chest from long ago many months ago when Id walk under loud maple trees feeling the orange and feeling the breeze just thinking of ways to be the best man I can be for her and perhaps even myself I want to live but only if I find a new nightmare that doesnt just zoom closer and closer into that impenetrable wall of soaking brunette hair that I playfully flipped grapevining her damn beautiful face that she hated If I had found these four hopeless mice last August Id have gently pressed a warm and wet Qtip against their bloated bits to mimic the tongue of their mother Baby mice need to shit and piss thats how mother mouse gets her babies to shit and piss and live But its not August theres no lava on my chest Its time to ditch erasersized rodents in the woods but Im too busy My lava left me and let me down but so did the rope It did the ropedydope and broke branding a brushburn into my neck that spoke to me like Anne Sullivan but in the language of burning skin instead of water and vibrations The muscles in my neck turned acoustic and my burning skin told me that if I try to kill myself again to just forget about it I dont deserve to live Not for myself not even for her damn beautiful face that she wasted The black fog had a death grip I pried it loose put it in a balloon with baby mice filled the balloon with helium then let g,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0

This is what depression’s like for me Its not as if Im sitting in despair Im liable to stare at the TV and cant be bothered to get off the chair My vision blurs and everything feels gray One could say that Im a royal bum Exactly what I feel is hard to say All that comes to mind is the word numb All the dishes languish in the sink The laundry isnt done for days on end Every thought is difficult to think My only consolationmy best friend The worst days are the ones I sleep for hours Disconnected from my family I wont get up to even take a shower and everything is meaningless to me Rarely I’ll be waiting for a train and think of how Id really like to jump So far at least I’ve talked back to my brain and mostly what I am is just a grump Im writing this to simply let you know not everyones depression looks the same Im hopeful now to see awareness grow For anyone who suffers have no sham,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1

Mr Nobody We enter each others lives at unforeseen times with no rhyme or reason as to how or why We share ourselves with one another or at least enough to keep us tethered together But who am I to you apart from text on screen Yes we tether ourselves together but it’ll never be forever We lead separate lives in parallel destined to never come together For I am a nobody a stranger in the street ready to be disposed of when you find a better piece of meat Are you even real or just a figment of my imagination Because all my life it feels like I’ve been living in a simulation You text me at five in the morning and ask to chat I smile kindly and we do just that We end the call and before you know it weeks have passed since I’ve seen your face I long for your embrace It was born out of a transaction but grew into more than sexual satisfaction I shared myself with you and from that I grew Your words cemented in my head things I can’t forget just yet Yet they are expected to be erased without a trace Will we ever meet again I hope so but if not I wish you well For time passes memories fade but you’ve still left an indelible mark on my brai,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0
